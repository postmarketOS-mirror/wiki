{{note|Right now we use the QEMU version installed on the host system, but we want to change that: {{github|1158}}}}
=== Building and starting a QEMU image ===

<pre class="shell">pmbootstrap init  # Choose a qemu-* device (x86_64: amd64, arm: vexpress-soc)
pmbootstrap install --no-fde
pmbootstrap qemu --image-size=2G</pre>
''Note: The <code>amd64</code> version is recommended if you don't know which one to choose. See the device specific pages (links below) for the differences.''

The <code>--image-size=2G</code> parameter will increase the image size to 2GB, so you don't instantly run out of space (by default the image size is as small as possible). Check out <code>pmbootstrap qemu --help</code> for more options, such as performance tweaks.

=== Qemu on Debian stretch ===

Qemu on Debian does not include SDL-support by default. To use pmbootstrap on Debian you have to do the following:
# Ensure that /etc/apt/sources.list contains a deb-src line for Debian buster or later.
# <code>sudo apt-get build-dep libvirglrenderer-dev/buster</code> (install build dependencies for libvirglrenderer)
# <code>fakeroot apt-get -b source libvirglrenderer-dev/buster</code> (download and build libvirglrenderer)
# <code>sudo dpkg -i libvirglrenderer0_0.6.0-2_amd64.deb libvirglrenderer-dev_0.6.0-2_amd64.deb</code> (install it)
# <code>sudo apt-get build-dep qemu/buster</code>
# <code>fakeroot apt-get -b source qemu/buster</code>
# Install the appropriate qemu Debian packages which have been created in the current directory.
