=== Building and starting a QEMU image ===

<pre class="shell">pmbootstrap init  # Choose a qemu-* device (x86_64: amd64, arm: vexpress-soc)
pmbootstrap install --no-fde
pmbootstrap qemu --image-size=2G</pre>
''Note: The <code>amd64</code> version is recommended if you don't know which one to choose. See the device specific pages (links below) for the differences.''

The <code>--image-size=2G</code> parameter will increase the image size to 2GB, so you don't instantly run out of space (by default the image size is as small as possible). Check out <code>pmbootstrap qemu --help</code> for more options, such as performance tweaks.
