== Installation ==
1. Follow the steps on [[Installation_guide#Initialization]]

2. Choose the <code>raspberry-pi</code> device

3. Select the kernel for your Raspberry Pi version
<source lang="shell-session">
[10:47:03] Which kernel do you want to use with your device?
[10:47:03] Available kernels (2):
[10:47:03] * rpi: Kernel for the Raspberry Pi 1
[10:47:03] * rpi2: Kernel for the Raspberry Pi 2
</source>

4. Start the build process and install the completed image to a sdcard 
<source lang="shell-session">
$ ./pmbootstrap.py install --sdcard /dev/sdX
(replace /dev/sdX with the device for your sdcard)
</source>

5. Place the sdcard into the Raspberry Pi and boot it
