== How to enter flash mode ==
Hold down POWER + Vol Down while booting to enter Flash Mode.

== Installation ==
As some features are still in development for this device, the kernel needs to be built from source using envkernel. To do this, you'll need a copy of
[https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/master/helpers/envkernel.sh envkernel.sh], and the [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/linux latest kernel tree]
for the device. Once you have those, and you have run <code>pmbootstrap init</code>, run the following commands:

<source>
cd /path/to/linux/kernel
source /path/to/envkernel.sh
make msm8916_defconfig pmos.config
make -j<cores>
pmbootstrap build --envkernel linux-postmarketos-qcom-msm8916
</source>

You will also need to install the [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd/releases/latest lk2nd bootloader], as it is required to handle some quirks
with msm8916 devices on mainline kernels. Flash the <code>lk2nd.img</code> image to the boot partition with <code>fastboot flash boot /path/to/lk2nd.img</code>. lk2nd
also provides a fastboot interface that allows for flashing kernels without overwriting lk2nd itself. To enter it, power on the device, then hold down Vol Down as soon
as you see the boot splash. You should be presented with a menu that looks like the following:

After that, proceed with [[Installation_guide#Installation_and_flashing|installation]] as usual, using lk2nd's fastboot interface to flash the kernel and rootfs.
