Phosh is a mobile desktop interface based on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME GNOME] stack. It was originally created for [https://puri.sm/ Purism]'s [https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/ Librem 5], but can be used on any device.

== Installation ==

Using <code>pmbootstrap</code>, Phosh can be installed by selecting it as the UI in <code>pmbootstrap init</code>.

On existing systems, it can be installed by installing the <code>postmarketos-ui-phosh</code> meta package or <code>phosh</code> if postmarketOS specific customization is not wanted.

When running <code>pmbootstrap install</code> to flash a phone or sd card you'll be prompted for a user password. Make sure to only use numeric characters [0-9] in this password as the phosh lock screen uses this password as a pin. On an existing phosh install you can change your user password and pin in the terminal with the standard <code>passwd</code> command.

== Starting Phosh ==

If <code>postmarketos-ui-phosh</code> is installed, Phosh will be automatically launched via the [https://github.com/canonical/lightdm LightDM] display manager.

It can also be launched manually by running <code>dbus-run-session /usr/bin/phosh</code>.

== Calls ==
For calls to work, you need to go into the sound settings, and set the Configuration to "Make a phone call". This will redirect sound through the modem. Also check the Modem section.

Note that this manual switching makes it practically unusable, see {{issue|644|pmaports}} for efforts to switch automatically.

== Modem ==
Since the modem settings page is not adapted for small screens one can set this up via the terminal. This example is for mobile vikings Belgium.
mmcli -m 0 --simple-connect='apn=web.be,user=web,password=web,pin=1111' 

This makes phone calls work.

== Screen Scaling ==
The Phosh screen may be scaled lower for better compatibility with existing applications. Change the scale by modifying the scale factor variable found in /usr/share/phosh/phoc.ini, which has a default value of 2.

Screen scaling may also be performed on-demand from the command line or by making an application by following the Purism [https://wp.puri.sm/posts/easy-librem-5-app-development-scale-the-screen/ Easy Librem 5 App Development: Scale the Screen] blog post. Those instructions work well for devices running Phosh even if written for a Librem5 running PureOS (Debian-based OS). Keep in mind some commands will need to be modified to work on PostmarketOS.
