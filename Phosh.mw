Phosh is a mobile desktop interface based on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME GNOME] stack. It was originally created for [https://puri.sm/ Purism]'s [https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/ Librem 5], but can be used on any device.

== Installation ==

Using <code>pmbootstrap</code>, Phosh can be installed by selecting it as the UI in <code>pmbootstrap init</code>.

On existing systems, it can be installed by installing the <code>postmarketos-ui-phosh</code> meta package or <code>phosh</code> if postmarketOS specific customization is not wanted.

When running <code>pmbootstrap install</code> to flash a phone or sd card you'll be prompted for a user password. Make sure to only use numeric characters [0-9] in this password as the phosh lock screen uses this password as a pin. On an existing phosh install you can change your user password and pin in the terminal with the standard <code>passwd</code> command.

== Starting Phosh ==

If <code>postmarketos-ui-phosh</code> is installed, Phosh will be automatically launched via the [https://github.com/canonical/lightdm LightDM] display manager.

It can also be launched manually by running <code>dbus-run-session /usr/bin/phosh</code>.

== Calls ==
For calls to work, you need to go into the sound settings, and set the Configuration to "Make a phone call". This will redirect sound through the modem.

Since the modem settings page is not adapted for small screens one can set this up via the terminal. This example is for mobile vikings Belgium.
mmcli -m 0 --simple-connect='apn=web.be,user=web,password=web,pin=1111' 

Calls then work, mobile data has an ip adress but the dns is not setup correctly yet.
