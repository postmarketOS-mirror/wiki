* Recovery: Hold PWR+HOME during boot.
* RAMDUMP: Hold PWR+HOME+VOLUP during boot.

== Installation ==
WORK IN PROGRESS, DO NOT ATTEMPT

There are likely better ways to do this, but this is all I could get working.

# Install rootfs to an sd card using `pmbootstrap install --sdcard=/dev/mmcblk0`
# On a Windows PC, Download Odin Multi Downloader v4.38
# Run pmbootstrap export --odin
# Grab boot.img-samsung-s5830 from /tmp/postmarketOS-export and use 7zip to compress it into a .tar archive
# In Odin, load Cooper_v1.0.ops and select your boot.tar as the BOOT image. Then press start.

== Notes ==
* This device covers the S5830, S5830D, S5830B, S5830L and S5830T, which are revisions of the same device. The [[Samsung Galaxy Ace i (samsung-s5830i)|S5830i]] is a different device and has its own port. S5830C and S5830M are unknown.
