== How to enter flash mode ==

Turn the device off and then press and hold [Vol down] and [Power] buttons until the selection appears. Select fastboot with [Vol down] and accept with [Vol up].

== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. WiFi, photos, ... -->
See [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/456 #456 Alternative flasher method (using netcat)].
Not all partitions can really be written to, even if there is enough space. I'm still figuring things out.
All other methods mentioned in Porting documentation (05.03.2020) worked so far. NFS not tested.
