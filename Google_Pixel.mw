== Note on device codenames and compatibility ==

The sailfish variant of the Google Pixel shares the same kernel builds as the Pixel XL (marlin). Therefore, anything here referencing sailfish should also be relevant to marlin.

== What works ==

* Kernel compilation
* Flashing

== What does not work ==

* Booting kernel via fastboot (see details below)
* Touch
* Screen
* WiFi
* Bluetooth (might actually work!)
* Camera
* GPS
* Modem

N.B: The Pixel/Pixel XL are slightly different in format to a typical Android ecosystem. They are given two partition slots, dubbed slot A & B. Out-of-the-box Android installations also enable filesystem encryption by default. However, this is a non-issue for pmOS, since TWRP can reformat the partition layout to drop FDE for testing.

Standard fastboot flashing is known working, however the kernel currently panics on boot:

<pre>
[   14.025620] No filesystem could mount root, tried:  ext3 ext2 ext4 vfat msdos fuseblk
[   14.033436] c2      1 Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(253,0)
</pre>

This seems pretty easy to solve; just need the time to look at where the filesystem is attempting to go. Might be unable to find the initramfs.

== How to enter flash mode ==

It is required that the device is '''cell carrier unlocked''' before attempting to perform an OEM unlock using fastboot.

* Enter fastboot by shutting down the device, and hold volume down + power until you see the fastboot screen.
* Depending on the phone's previous sleep state, you may be alerted that a RAM dump is in progress. Ignore these, keep holding the buttons until you end up in fastboot.

Once cell unlocked, you must OEM unlock from fastboot through the standard command:
<pre>
<nowiki>#fastboot oem unlock</nowiki>
</pre>

Be sure that you are using fastboot slot A. If you need to change slots, perform:
<pre>
<nowiki>#fastboot set_active a
#fastboot reboot bootloader</nowiki>
</pre>

At this point, you should be ready to test pmOS deployments.

== Installation ==

More details to this section are coming soon.
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->

=== Backup with TWRP ===
Take precaution, and keep backups if this is your primary device.

* [https://twrp.me/google/googlepixel.html Download the latest TWRP (both img and zip)]
* From the TWRP directory, run the fastboot command: <pre>#fastboot boot <nowiki><your-twrp.img></nowiki></pre>
* At this point, TWRP will load
* Take your backup, note this does not include the user data directory. You need to copy that over with MTP as well.

=== Installation Steps ===
<pre><nowiki>
#fastboot set_active a
#fastboot reboot bootloader
#pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs
#pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel
#fastboot reboot
</nowiki></pre>

== Serial Debugging ==

It is possible to debug the Pixel/Pixel XL with a standard [[Serial debugging|Nexus Serial debug cable]]. This must be enabled in fastboot first:
<pre>
#fastboot oem uart enable
</pre>

The baud rate is 115200.

== To Do List ==

=== Done ===

* [ojbr] - Serial debugging is possible with the kernel builds available on my mirror repository
* [ojbr] - Re-enable LZMA kernel image compression, add via makedepends
* [ojbr] - Test device flashing using fastboot

=== Doing ===

* [ojbr] - Fix kernel panic on boot

=== Backlog === 

* Investigate Kernel upgrade path to 4.X where MSM8996 has better support in mainline
