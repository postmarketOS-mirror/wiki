<!-- This person needs to be willing to answer questions from users of this device -->

== Note on device codenames and compatibility ==

The sailfish variant of the Google Pixel shares the same kernel builds as the Pixel XL (marlin). Therefore, anything here referencing sailfish should also be relevant to marlin.

== What works ==

TLDR;

* Nothing

Installation using normal measures does not successfully boot. This is likely due to the fact that the Google Pixel's fastboot has two boot slots (A and B).
What this effectively means is that fastboot allows you to dual boot. That's nice and all, but it's annoying. What we will likely have to do is flash via TWRP. Needs more investigation.

== What does not work ==

Watch this space.

== How to enter flash mode ==

It is required that the device is '''cell carrier unlocked''' before attempting to perform an OEM unlock using fastboot.

== Installation ==

Coming soon

<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->

== Serial Debugging ==

Sounds like this is possible, given kernel has serial debugging enabled.

== To Do List ==

=== Doing ===

* [ojbr] - Investigate serial debugging. Obtained a USB FTDI device, just need to hack together a 3.5mm TRRS cable

=== Backlog === 

* Re-enable LZMA kernel image compression, add via makedepends
* Test device flashing using fastboot
* Investigate Kernel upgrade path to 4.X where MSM8996 has better support in mainline
