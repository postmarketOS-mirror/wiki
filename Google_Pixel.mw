== Pixel / Pixel XL ==

The Pixel (sailfish) and Pixel XL (marlin) share identical kernel architectures. This port should work for both devices.

=== Device Owners ===

==== Pixel ====

==== Pixel XL ====

== What works ==

* Kernel compilation
* Flashing
* Booting kernel (serial only)

== What does not work ==

* SSH over USB
* Touch
* Screen
* WiFi
* Bluetooth
* Camera
* GPS
* Modem

== Development Notes ==

=== Partition Layout ===

Out of the box, the Google Pixel uses an A/B partition layout. Both slots are known working. Should you need to change slots, this can be done with:
<pre>
<nowiki>#fastboot set_active a
#fastboot reboot bootloader</nowiki>
</pre>

<pre>
~#: fdisk -l /dev/block/sda

keymaster_a     keymaster_b
tz_a            tz_b
rpm_a           rpm_b
pmic_a          pmic_b
hyp_a           hyp_b

== Bootloader Unlocking ==

The bootloader can be unlocked once the device has been unlocked by the cell carrier. An unlock code is usually obtained from your network provider directly, or from a third party.
Be aware, a bootloader unlock will erase all userdata. Make sure to keep a backup of any important data.

* Enter fastboot by shutting down the device, and hold volume down + power until you see the fastboot screen.
* Depending on the phone's previous sleep state, you may be alerted that a RAM dump is in progress. Ignore these, keep holding the buttons until you end up in fastboot.

The standard OEM unlock command can then be be used:
<pre>
<nowiki>#fastboot oem unlock</nowiki>
</pre>

At this point, you should be ready to test pmOS deployments.

== Installation ==

More details to this section are coming soon.
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->

=== Backup with TWRP ===
Take precaution, and keep backups if this is your primary device.

* [https://twrp.me/google/googlepixel.html Download the latest TWRP (both img and zip)]
* From the TWRP directory, run the fastboot command: <pre>#fastboot boot <nowiki><your-twrp.img></nowiki></pre>
* At this point, TWRP will load
* Take your backup, note this does not include the user data directory. You need to copy that over with MTP as well.

=== Installation Steps ===
<pre><nowiki>
# fastboot set_active a
# fastboot reboot bootloader
# pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs
# pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel
# fastboot reboot
</nowiki></pre>

== Debugging ==

=== Kernel Logging via Serial ===

It is possible to debug the Pixel/Pixel XL with a standard [[Serial debugging|Nexus Serial debug cable]]. This must be enabled in fastboot first:
<pre>
# fastboot oem uart enable
</pre>

The baud rate is 115200.

== Troubleshooting ==

==== Unable to mount rootfs ====

When running from a vendor kernel, Android is configured to skip loading with an initramfs. For postmarketOS to boot, the offending change would have to be removed with a [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/merge_requests/66/diffs?commit_id=b6a70454d1e999678fe8d770ed3d59bd28da8549 patch].

Without the patch, the rootfs will fail to mount:
<pre>
[   14.025620] No filesystem could mount root, tried:  ext3 ext2 ext4 vfat msdos fuseblk
[   14.033436] c2      1 Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(253,0)
</pre>

==== Firmware image not available ====

Proprietary [https://developers.google.com/android/drivers#sailfish vendor drivers] are missing, and will need to be built into the resulting boot image.

<pre>
[TP]: [ERR]:fwu_start_reflash: Firmware image synaptics_bl71.img not available
</pre>
