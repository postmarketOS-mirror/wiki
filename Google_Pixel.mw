<!-- Only if this device doesn't run on linux-postmarketos yet! -->
<!-- This person needs to be willing to answer questions from users of this device -->

== Note on device codenames and compatibility ==

The sailfish variant of the Google Pixel shares the same kernel builds as the Pixel XL (marlin). Therefore, anything here referencing sailfish should also be relevant to marlin.

== What works ==

Untested as of 2018-03-28.

== What does not work ==

Watch this space.

== How to enter flash mode ==

It is required that the device is '''cell carrier unlocked''' before attempting to perform an OEM unlock using fastboot.

== Installation ==

Coming soon
