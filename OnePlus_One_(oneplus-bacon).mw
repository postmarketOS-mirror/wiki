== Display refresh ==
There is a bug whereby the screen is not automatically refreshed. To work around this, run the following command as root on the device:
<pre># while [ ! ]; do cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/modes > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/mode; done</pre>

== Mainlining ==
[[User:jrg|Julian Goldsmith]] is currently [https://gitlab.com/julian-goldsmith/linux-postmarketos/tree/qcom-old working on] mainlining the OnePlus One, based on flacks's [https://github.com/flacks/linux/blob/bacon/v4.15-rc6/arch/arm/boot/dts/qcom-msm8974-oneplus-bacon.dts initial DTS].  Right now, he's using a fork of [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/linux-postmarketos/tree/qcom linux-postmarketos], and is trying to get hardware-accelerated graphics up and running.

=== Graphics ===
The Adreno 330 GPU is supported by Freedreno.  The firmware is required, and is available in the adreno-firmware package.

Julian Goldsmith currently has partially-working graphics support on mainline.  The GPU is usable, but the display doesn't properly update.  The issue most likely involves clock or regulator settings somehow.

=== Cell usage ===
oFono support shouldn't take too much to get up and running.  Adding the remoteproc node, using qmictl (possibly more utilities), and using a patched oFono should get basic support up and running.

=== WiFi and Bluetooth ===
WiFi and Bluetooth are working, but aren't fully tested.  They are most likely flakey.

== Additional info ==

=== Entering fastboot mode ===

From a power off state, hold the '''volume up''' and '''power''' buttons until the device vibrates. The display should then light up and say "Fastboot Mode".
