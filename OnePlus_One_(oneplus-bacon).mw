== What works ==

* Kernel compilation
* Flashing system
* Booting kernel via fastboot
* initramfs boot
* Flashing kernel
* USB network
* SSH connectivity
* Weston
* Touchscreen

== What doesn't work ==

* Wi-Fi (blob needed)
* Graphics
* ...

== Display refresh ==
There is a bug whereby the screen is not automatically refreshed. To work around this, run the following command as root on the device:
<pre># while [ ! ]; do cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/modes > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/mode; done</pre>

== Graphics (hardware-accelerated) ==
The Adreno 330 GPU is supported by Freedreno.  The firmware is required, and is available in the adreno-firmware package.

The latest commit of xf86-video-freedreno will compile, but crashes in libdrm when it tries to initialize kgsl+fbdev.  The kernel log states that it won't initialize a drawing context using the "legacy method".

linux-oneplus-bacon uses an old (~3.4) kernel version from LineageOS, which most likely uses an incompatible implementation of kgsl.  Getting graphics up will probably require the kernel to be mainlined.  I ([[User:jrg|jrg]]) think that's what [[User:Flacks|flacks]] was most recently working on.

== Additional info ==

=== Entering fastboot mode ===

From a power off state, hold the '''volume up''' and '''power''' buttons until the device vibrates. The display should then light up and say "Fastboot Mode".
