== How to enter flash mode ==
Hold the Volume Down button, and then press the Power button 

== Installation ==
* Unlock (s-off) the bootloader if it hasn't been unlocked before ([https://www.htcdev.com/bootloader/] unlock site)
* Boot the device in HBOOT mode and select fastboot 
* Flash pmOS using pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs
* Flash kernel using pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel

== Other ==
The workaround for the red scerren issue listed [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Troubleshooting:display#My_screen_is_red.21 here] does not seem to work on this device.
Instead we need to change a Kernel configuration and disable '''CONFIG_FB_MSM_DEFAULT_DEPTH_RGBA8888''' and enable '''CONFIG_FB_MSM_DEFAULT_DEPTH_RGB565=y'''
