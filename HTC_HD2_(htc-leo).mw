== What works ==
* Nothing

== What does not work ==
* Everything

== Progress ==
* Got the kernel to compile, based on [https://github.com/maniacx/android_kernel_htc_qsd8k maniacx's nougat android kernel]

== Next steps ==
* Find a way to test the kernel on the device (black cLK?)

== Bootloaders ==
Because of the age of the HD2, there are serval 3rd party bootloaders available, most commonly used:
* Haret, Haret is a bootloader (provided as haret.exe) to boot linux or android from WITHIN windows mobile, you start windows mobile, not a great choice for postmarketOS.
* a(MagLDR), Propitary 3rd party bootloader developed by Cotulla, some folks over at [https://androidforum.tytung.com Tytung's android forum], reverse egineered it and created aMagLdr, still propietary (?)
*[https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1114053 cLK], based on littlekernel and download possible with cwm or twrp recovery embedded, seems to be the best option. Littlekernel also provides fastboot wich is handy.
