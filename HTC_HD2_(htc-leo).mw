== What works ==
* Kernel boots
* Screen works, but output is messed up, probably because there is a wrong value in /sys/class/graphics/fb0/bits_per_pixel

== What does not work ==
* Everything else, including ssh and telnet connectivity

== Progress ==
* Got the kernel to compile, based on [https://github.com/maniacx/android_kernel_htc_qsd8k maniacx's nougat android kernel]
* The qsd8k-legacy kernel also works : [https://github.com/qsd8k-legacy/android_kernel_htc_htcleo]
* Screen is partially working now.

== Next steps ==
* Change the value in /sys/class/graphics/fb0/bits_per_pixel to the correct one to fix display output. Here are the sources : [https://github.com/Dominduchami/HTC-HD2-Postmarketos]

== Bootloaders ==
Because of the age of the HD2, there are serval 3rd party bootloaders available, most commonly used:
* Haret, Haret is a bootloader (provided as haret.exe) to boot linux or android from WITHIN windows mobile, you start windows mobile, not a great choice for postmarketOS.
* a(MagLDR), Propitary 3rd party bootloader developed by Cotulla, some folks over at [https://androidforum.tytung.com Tytung's android forum], reverse egineered it and created aMagLdr, still propietary (?)
*[https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1114053 cLK], based on littlekernel and download possible with cwm or twrp recovery embedded, seems to be the best option. Littlekernel also provides fastboot wich is handy. Only this bootloader is tested right now.
