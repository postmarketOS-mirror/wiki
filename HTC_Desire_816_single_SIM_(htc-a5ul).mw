== Installation ==
{{note|The bootloader have to been unlocked (s-off). If not, see [https://www.htcdev.com/bootloader/ htcdev here].}}

* Install 
** using an microsd card (replace mmcblk0 with your sd slot, recommended): <code>pmbootstrap install --sdcard=/dev/mmcblk0</code>
** until {{github|1206}} is fixed, it is necessary to copy the extracted [[QCDT]] from a known working ROM such as the TWRP image (see {{github|1378}}):
*** <code>sudo cp ~/mkbootimg/boot.img-dtb ~/.local/var/pmbootstrap/chroot_rootfs_htc-a5ul/boot/dt.img</code>
** using /data partition <code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs --partition userdata</code> 
* Insert the microsd card on the device
* Connect usb cable to your phone and boot it into flash mode (HBOOT)
* Select "FASTBOOT" by volumes and power button. Make sure it displays "FASTBOOT USB" on top.
** Boot kernel using <code>pmbootstrap flasher boot</code>(recommended)
** Flash kernel using <code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</code>, then reboot.

== Misc ==
The device is similar to the flagship in 2014, hTC One (m8) in many aspect.

Some resources can be shared between two devices.
