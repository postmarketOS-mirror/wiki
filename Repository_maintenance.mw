This page is about maintaining the official binary package repository of postmarketOS. It does not relate to the local package repository that <code>pmbootstrap</code> creates when compiling packages. So most people will not need this.

== Qt upgrade ==
There are KDE packages, which need to be rebuilt after each Qt upgrade:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap pkgrel_bump kwayland kwin plasma-framework kdeclarative
</syntaxhighlight>

See {{issue|130|pmaports}} for an idea to automatize this and for more information.

== Fixing upstream incompatibilities with Alpine's repository ==

The following script checks out the master branch of pmbootstrap and pmaports, automatically bumps the pkgrels that need to be bumped because of soname bumps, and regenerates all aports that are based on Alpine's aports.
Finally it executes the upstream compatibility test case again, which should run through again with the changes it made.

After the script ran, manually check the diff in the pmaports.git repository. Then make reasonable patches and commit messages from the changes.
