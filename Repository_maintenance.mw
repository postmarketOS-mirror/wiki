This page is about maintaining the official binary package repository of postmarketOS. It does not relate to the local package repository that <code>pmbootstrap</code> creates when compiling packages. So most people will not need this.

== QT upgrade ==
There are KDE packages, which need to be rebuilt after each QT upgrade:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap pkgrel_bump kwayland kwin plasma-framework kdeclarative frameworkintegration plasma-integration 
</syntaxhighlight>

See {{issue|130|pmaports}} for an idea to automatize this and for more information.
