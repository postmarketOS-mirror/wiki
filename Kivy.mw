Kivy is a useful python framework that will allow you to make full multi-touch apps quickly for your device. 

== Dependencies ==
Use "sudo APK install" for the following dependencies. All of them might not be needed, but this is what it took for me to get running
* python2
* python2-dev
* py2-pip
* gcc
* musl-dev
* py2-setuptools
* binutils
* linux-headers
* musl-utils
* py-opengl
* mesa-dev

Use "pip install --user" for the following dependencies. All of these are mandatory.
* cython===0.25.2
There's a version requirement for cython, so make sure you install this version. Could be subject to change in the future
* kivy
