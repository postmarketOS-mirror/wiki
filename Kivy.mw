Kivy is a useful python framework that will allow you to make full multi-touch apps quickly for your device. 

== Dependencies ==
Use "sudo APK install" for the following dependencies. All of them might not be needed, but this is what it took for me to get running
* python3
* python3-dev
* gcc
* musl-dev
* binutils
* linux-headers
* musl-utils
* py-opengl
* mesa-dev

Use "pip install --user" for the following dependencies. All of these are mandatory.
* cython===0.25.2

There's a version requirement for cython, so make sure you install this version. Could be subject to change in the future
* kivy

You will need to install PyGame as well
* download and compile from source for libjpg
Their other dependencies are sdl and can be found as APK packages
