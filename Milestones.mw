postmarketOS aims to be like a typical Linux distribution - with lots of possibilities to choose from. And with a default selection of components, that are most useful to casual users.<br />
This means, that there is no concrete plan, that everyone must follow for it to succeed. Instead, '''everyone is encouraged to work on what they enjoy most!'''

In consequence, pmOS does not use a regular milestone plan with versions (at least right now). Here is a list with what individuals are working on. '''Feel free to add yourself here and what you are interested in''' (optionally with priorities and estimated finish date), but you don't have to! If you do, please keep your section of this list updated.

'''These are all estimations''' and the community is expected to understand when something does not work out as planned here. This is a free time project after all, so be grateful, that the individuals step up and share their plans at all.

Basically all points listed below are done together with other community members. In fact, when I do postmarketOS work today, it is most of the time ''not'' running/porting pmOS on a device, but doing something else from below.

'''Make development enjoyable for everybody:'''
* fix all pmbootstrap bugs
* test / review / integrate pull-requests
* help whenever someone is stuck with development
* find, write down and resolve technical debt
* work on features, that make development easier (e.g. {{github|688}} new kernel porting workflow, {{github|383}} split aports into its own git repository)
* assist with implementation ideas in GitHub issues
* improve documentation in the wiki
* improve continuous integration (e.g. {{github|110}} more automatic shell checking, {{github|760}} run fast tests in Travis)
* write about what we do in [http://postmarketos.org/blog/ blog posts]
* help with infrastructure (homepage, wiki, ...)
* work together with upstream

'''Get postmarketOS ready for daily usage:'''
* research on how we could implement "daily driver" stuff (e.g. {{github|161}} plasma-mobile, {{github|598}} cellular modem, {{github|592}} firmware patching)
* binary package repository

'''My plan for telephony:'''
* Mainline the [[Google_Nexus_4_(lg-mako)|Nexus 4]], improve <code>pmbootstrap</code> tooling for mainlining (e.g. {{github|1210}}) and [[The_Mainline_Kernel|writing a step by step mainlining guide]] (like the porting guide) in the process. I've learned a lot about mainlining, and for the most part it's writing the dts file from what I understand, at least when all the phone's components are in upstream already (which is the case for the Nexus 4 from what I know).
* Get telephony working on that with ofono and [[QMI]] (there's a QMI driver in the mainline kernel)

# Evangelization
#* project-specific (devs)
#* Means: current: word of mouth in Sao Paulo ; future: meetups, talks, panels, presentations
#* philosophy and anthropology of tool-making (gateway for layperson to the hacking community)
#* Means: writings and discussions with intellectuals, the urban youth, the homeless, and the elite of Sao Paulo society
# On-boarding and new dev integration
# Documentation<br />

In general, get postmarketOS to a ready for daily usage state, in my case getting packages and UI packaged for the end user to install. Right now focus is on:

# Packaging Phone UI: Plasma Mobile
# Packaging Phone UI: UBports/Yunit
