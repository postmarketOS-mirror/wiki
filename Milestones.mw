postmarketOS aims to be like a typical Linux distribution - with lots of possibilities to choose from. And with a default selection of components, that are most useful to casual users.<br />
This means, that there is no concrete plan, that everyone must follow for it to succeed. Instead, '''everyone is encouraged to work on what they enjoy most!'''

In consequence, pmOS does not use a regular milestone plan with versions (at least right now). Here is a list with what individuals are working on. '''Feel free to add yourself here and what you are interested in''' (optionally with priorities and estimated finish date), but you don't have to! If you do, please keep your section of this list updated, and remove finished tasks.

'''These are all estimations''' and the community is expected to understand when something does not work out as planned here. This is a free time project after all, so be grateful, that the individuals step up and share their plans at all.
