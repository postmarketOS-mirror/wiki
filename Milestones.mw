postmarketOS aims to be like a typical Linux distribution - with lots of possibilities to choose from. And with a default selection of components, that are most useful to casual users.<br />
This means, that there is no concrete plan, that everyone must follow for it to succeed. Instead, '''everyone is encouraged to work on what they enjoy most!'''

In consequence, pmOS does not use a regular milestone plan with versions (at least right now). Here is a list with what individuals are working on. '''Feel free to add yourself here and what you are interested in''' (optionally with priorities and estimated finish date), but you don't have to! If you do, please keep your section of this list updated.

'''These are all estimations''' and the community is expected to understand when something does not work out as planned here. This is a free time project after all, so be grateful, that the individuals step up and share their plans at all.

Basically all points listed below are done together with other community members. In fact, when I do postmarketOS work today, it is most of the time ''not'' running/porting pmOS on a device, but doing something else from below.

'''Make development enjoyable for everybody:'''
* fix all pmbootstrap bugs
* test / review / integrate pull-requests
* help whenever someone is stuck with development
* work on features, that make development easier (e.g. [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/256 strict mode])
* assist with implementation ideas in GitHub issues
* improve documentation in the wiki
* improve continuous integration (e.g. [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/110 #110], [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/64 #64])
* write about what we do in [http://postmarketos.org/blog/ blog posts]
* help with infrastructure (homepage, wiki, ...)
* work together with upstream

'''Get postmarketOS ready for daily usage:'''
* research on how we could implement "daily driver" stuff (e.g. [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/161 plasma-mobile], [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/598 cellular modem], [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/592 firmware patching])
* binary package repository (not usable yet, see [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/64 #64])

# Try to post as much different devices as portable to find edgecases in the build process

# Evangelization
#* project-specific (devs)
#* Means: current: word of mouth in Sao Paulo ; future: meetups, talks, panels, presentations
#* philosophy and anthropology of tool-making (gateway for layperson to the hacking community)
#* Means: writings and discussions with intellectuals, the urban youth, the homeless, and the elite of Sao Paulo society
# On-boarding and new dev integration
# Documentation<br />

In general, get postmarketOS to a ready for daily usage state, in my case getting packages and UI packaged for the end user to install. Right now focus is on:

# Packaging Phone UI: Plasma Mobile
# Packaging Phone UI: UBports/Yunit

# Get bootloader for Coolpad Modena 2 opensourced and unlocked. Requires lots of reverse engineering work.
# Eventually start porting device to pmOS.
# Write open source replacement for SP flashtool (very low priority).
