== CPU ==
All cores are working on different clock speeds for each clusters. Marked as partial because there is no support for CPU Idle and SDM632 SoC. 

== Display ==
Display works with both simplefb and msm-drm (with FB takeover). Dual DSI configuration is not tested.

== GPU ==
GPU preemption (only supported on some 5xx GPUs) is disabled because of deadlock problem in msm drm driver. 

== Video Encoder / Decoder (Venus) ==
Venus boots and registers, but doesn't quite work yet. Further investigation is necessary...
TODO: Add test commands and files to test venus

== Modem ==
The modem boots and responds to commands, but unlike older qcom modems which use SMD to communicate, it uses qrtr. qrtr support in userspace tools is still in the initial stages, as of now only libqmi seems to support it. Other tools like modem-manager and ofono have no support, but some work is being done on modem-manager.

== Mainlining ==
MSM8953 is almost as great platform to get started with mainlining as MSM8916! The [[MSM8916 Mainlining]] guide is quite relevant to it.
