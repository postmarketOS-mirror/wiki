== CPU ==
All cores are working on different clock speeds for each clusters. Marked as partial because there is no support for CPU Idle and SDM632 SoC. 

== Display ==
Display works with both simplefb and msm-drm (with FB takeover). Dual DSI configuration is not tested.

== GPU ==
GPU works without preemption and on reduced clock speed.

== Mainlining ==
MSM8953 is almost as great platform to get started with mainlining as MSM8916! The [[MSM8916 Mainlining]] guide is quite relevant to it.
