{{note|Work in progress: see {{milestone|6}} for current status}}

Devices that are working quite well get lost in the [[Devices|big matrix of booting devices]]. To improve the situation, devices postmarketOS runs on will be grouped into the following categories.

== Categories ==

{| class="wikitable sortable"
!Category
!Actively maintained
!Description
|-
| main
| yes, >= 2 people
| Everything in community, plus required working features (where available):
* Usable phone UI (i.e. Plasma Mobile or Phosh)
* Calls (incl. call audio with earpiece)
* SMS
* Mobile Data
* WiFi
* Audio (speaker, main microphone ; headset, headset microphone ; jack detection, headset buttons)
* Battery charging
* Bluetooth
Not required (shall change in the future):
* Camera

Devices in main must run a (close to) mainline kernel and must not use Halium/libhybris.

|-
| community
| yes
| No fixed feature requirements. Purpose of community is to increase visibility of devices that:
* a lot of work was put into
* are (and stay) working quite well (i.e. they are useful in some way and are tested occasionally to find and fix regressions)
* are still being improved or are considered completed at some point
* are (and stay) overall in good shape

|-
| testing
| no
| All other device ports, including new ones. Maintainers can create merge requests to move devices to ''community'' if requirements are met.
|-
| unmaintained
| no
| Known broken device ports are stored here, binary packages are not built for these. The rationale is, that it is easier to restore ports from such an ''unmaintained'' dir.
|}

== Maintainers ==
A device maintainer must own the device and be able to test changes. They must make sure that the device port stays in good shape.

== Moving between categories ==

=== Moving to a higher category ===
Moving from testing to community, from community to main or even from testing straight to main.

==== Request process ====
* Make sure that the device fulfills all requirements for the new category (see table above).
* Create a new merge request in which you move the files.
* Add new maintainers to the device's APKBUILD in the merge request, if necessary.

==== Review process ====
* The core team collects approvals as usual, but requires '''four approvals''' (instead of the usual two).
* Everyone should be given the chance to look at the entire device port again, to identify issues/possible improvements. Therefore the MR should not be merged before a '''minimum time of one week''' passed.
* Reviewers should look at all files that were moved and add comments as necessary. (GitLab currently doesn't allow in-line comments for moved files {{issue|213446|gitlab|gitlab-org}}, so just add comments below the merge request.)
* Reviewers should verify that the device fulfills all requirements for the new category (see table above).
* Reviewers should pay special attention to consistency issues, as outlined in {{issue|24|postmarketos}}.
* Consistency issues/possible improvements in the existing features (not missing features) should be discussed and ideally fixed before merge.
** Consistency changes that require lots of work should be documented as issues at least. (Let's not unnecessarily delay merge, that's annoying for everyone.)

=== Moving to a lower category ===
If rules to keep a device in a category are no longer fulfilled, we should create a merge request to move them to the now appropriate category. So far we did not come up with extra rules, so we would treat it just like any other merge request.
