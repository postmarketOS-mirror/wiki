== Screen ==

For some reason using msm-fb-refresher makes the screen incredibly dim on Weston. In order for the screen to work, this package shouldn't be installed(if you explicitly didn't you don't need to worry about it) and you need to follow [[Troubleshooting:display#Screen_doesn.27t_refresh]] everytime you boot up your device. This is why the display is marked as partial.

== How to enter flash mode ==

1. The easiest way is to turn off your phone and press the Power button and the Volume Up button at the same time

== Installation ==


1.The [[Installation guide]] should cover everything. Make sure to remove the encryption from the userdata partition if you're going to use it as rootfs(you can use Format Data from TWRP if you want)!
