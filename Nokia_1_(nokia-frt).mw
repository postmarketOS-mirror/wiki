== What works ==
* Flashing
* Booting
* ssh
* osk-sdl/charging-sdl
* touch

== What does not work ==
* Everything else
* after entering pass in osk-sdl it's stuck on "loading...", see {{issue|194|pmaports}}
* charging-sdl shows wrong percentage & crashes after few seconds on '''(!!!) *** UNIMPLEMENTED [fusion_get_fusionee_pid] *** [fusion.c:4147]'''

== Current progress ==

=== Downstream kernel ===
There are official sources for 3.18, The CPU itself is aarch64 but the kernel was made for arm(v7) mode.

CPU cores are hotplugged.

=== Upstream kernel ===
Doesn't exist yet, dts files for the phone are available in downstream kernel

== How to enter flash mode ==
=== Directly to fastboot ===
Plug in USB, press and hold power and press and hold volume down as fast as you can, then release power when you see Nokia logo.

=== Through recovery ===
Plug in USB, press and hold power and press and hold volume down as fast as you can, then release power when you see Nokia logo. "No command" should appear. Press and hold power and then press and hold Volume Up and release both buttons after screen changes.

Scroll to bootloader using Vol up/down keys and press power to confirm.

== Installation ==

First unlock the phone by hashing the serial number with MD5

<source lang="shell-session">
// Have the phone booted in android and developer mode enabled
$ adb get-serialno
FRTBA80306545107

// Hash the serial number
$ echo -n FRTBA80306545107 | md5sum
e2a0704c877da26c57a305c216bf7245  -

// Feed the key to fastboot
$ sudo fastboot oem key e2a0704c877da26c57a305c216bf7245

// Unlock the bootloader
$ sudo fastboot oem unlock
</source>

Follow standard installation instructions after unlocking
