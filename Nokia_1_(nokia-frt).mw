== What works ==
* Flashing
* Booting
* ssh
* osk-sdl

== What does not work ==
* Everything else
* after entering pass in osk-sdl it's stuck on "loading..."

== Current progress ==

=== Kernel ===
There are official sources for 3.18, The CPU itself is aarch64 but the kernel is made for armv7 mode, compiling for armhf first, then going up.

=== boot.img ===
Boot.img offsets are in kernel's readme file:
<pre>
  Step 2: Assembling the boot.img
    (In the output directory)
	$ mkbootimg --kernel arch/arm/boot/zImage-dtb --cmdline "bootopt=64S3,32N2,32N2 buildvariant=userdebug" \
	  --base 0x40000000 --kernel_offset 0x00008000 --ramdisk_offset 0x04000000 --tags_offset 0xE000000 \
	  --ramdisk ramdisk.img --output boot.img
</pre>

== How to enter flash mode ==
=== first method ===
Plug in USB, then Press Volume Up + power. When Nokia logo appears release power. "No command" should appear. Press Volume UP + power simultaneously and quickly release both buttons. You should be in recovery mode now.

Scroll to bootloader using Vol up/down keys and press power to confirm.

=== second method ===
Plug in USB, Press Volume Down and power simultaneously, then release power when you see nokia logo.

This may be harder (at least for the author of this manual)

== Installation ==
Follow standard installation instruction
