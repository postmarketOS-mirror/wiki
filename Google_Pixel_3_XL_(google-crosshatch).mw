== How to enter flash mode ==

The Pixel 3 XL, like all Google Pixel/Nexus devices, uses Fastboot as the flashing protocol.

To enter Fastboot mode, hold Volume Down while powering on the device. Let go of Volume Down when "Fastboot mode" displays on the screen.

== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->

== Status ==

Kernel successfully builds, haven't tested flashing yet.
