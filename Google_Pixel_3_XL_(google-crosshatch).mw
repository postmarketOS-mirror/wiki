== How to enter flash mode ==

The Pixel 3 XL, like all Google Pixel/Nexus devices, uses Fastboot as the flashing protocol.

To enter Fastboot mode, hold Volume Down while powering on the device. Let go of Volume Down when "Fastboot mode" displays on the screen.

== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->

== Status ==

The kernel boots, the rootfs flashes and mounts, and ssh works. However, the device is not ready for merging yet, due to these issues:

* The device uses 4096 byte sectors instead of 512 byte sectors, and requires a change in pmbootstrap to generate and flash images.
* Screen doesn't work (no boot splash or Weston)
* USB doesn't have correct idVendor/idProduct, since this kernel is more strict regarding the formatting. This breaks USB network when developing using VirtualBox USB passthrough.
* See merge request {{MR|83}} for current status.
