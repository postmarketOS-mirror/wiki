=== What works ===

* Installation to sdcard (<code>pmbootstrap install --sdcard=/dev/mmcblk...</code>)
* Installation to device memory (partial)
* Touchscreen
* Weston (only on SD card)
* XWayland

=== What does not work ===

* The rest (Wifi, bluetooth, making calls, ...)
* Auto resizing partitions during installation to device memory (probably)

=== How to enter flash mode ===

'''For i9100'''
* Connect a USB cable
* Make sure, the device is powered off
* Hold power + volume down
* As soon, as the samsung logo appears on the screen, only press volume down

'''For d710'''
* Connect a USB cable
* Make sure, the device is powered off
* Hold power + volume down
* When prompted, release all buttons and press volume up

=== Installation ===

Flashing to device memory uses [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/456 drebrez's netcat method (#456)].

Init pmbootstrap. Make sure to choose ''none'' for the user interface instead of ''weston'' because ''weston'' makes the image just a little bit too large for the unresized partition.

<source lang="shell">$ ./pmbootstrap.py init</source>

Start the build process

<source lang="shell">$ ./pmbootstrap.py install</source>

Flash postmarketOS to the device:

https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/456

For the d710, on step 5 use ''/dev/mmcblk0p11'' as the install partition.

On step 8, use <source lang="shell">pv /home/user/rootfs/samsung-i9100.img | nc 172.16.42.1 60000</source> instead.

- Build image (on your computer)

-- Install pmboostrap

  $ git clone https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap.git

-- Change working directory to the pmboostrap

  $ cd pmbootstrap/

-- Configure

  $ ./pmbootstrap.py init
  [18:27:09] Device [samsung-i9100]: samsung-i9100
  [18:27:45] User interface [weston]: weston
  [18:28:05] Work path [/home/<USER>/.local/var/pmbootstrap]:
  [18:28:29] Jobs [5]:
  [18:28:46] Timestamp based rebuilds (y/n) [y]:
  [18:29:05] Extra packages [none]:

-- Build device package

  $ ./pmbootstrap.py build device-samsung-i9100

-- Build device kernel

  $ ./pmbootstrap.py build linux-samsung-i9100

-- Prepapre the installation

  $ ./pmbootstrap.py install

- Flash to phone memory - This will replace (break) your current phone system!
The description is using the alternative flash method because there it did not work for me with heimdall - https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/Heimdall/issues/418

-- Set phone to ODIN mode

  1. Turn off phone
  2. Connect USB cable
  3. Hold VOLUME_DOWN + HOME + POWER until you get Warning!! screen
  4. Push VOLUME_UP to continue to ODIN mode screen

-- Set image for NETCAT flash method

  $ ./pmbootstrap.py initfs hook_add usb-shell

-- Flash Kernel and Recovery (phone will reboot to screen with postmarketOS logo)

  $ ./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_kernel

-- Connect to phone with telnet

  $ telnet 172.16.42.1 24

-- Start netcat to listen for image (on the phone)
''/dev/mmcblk0p9 should be FACTORYFS partition you check by running fdisk -l /dev/mmcblk0''

  / # nc -v -l -p 60000 > /dev/mmcblk0p9

-- Switch to pmboostrap chroot (on the computer in other terminal)

  $ ./pmbootstrap.py chroot --suffix native

-- Install pv (in the chroot)

  / # apk add pv

-- Send image from computer to netcat (on the computer)

  / # pv /home/user/rootfs/samsung-i9100.img | nc 172.16.42.1 60000

-- Restart phone with POWER button when transfer finishes

=== Boot process ===

We're using the <code>heimdall-isorec</code> flash method, see [[deviceinfo_flash_methods]] for more information.

=== Wifi ===

''Please edit this to match the style of wiki.''

I got wifi working on gt-i9100 with following procedure:

- Created path /system/etc/wifi

mkdir -p /system/etc/wifi

- Downloaded firmware files from https://github.com/TheMuppets/proprietary_vendor_samsung/tree/cm-14.1/i9100/proprietary/system/etc/wifi and saved to /system/etc/wifi

- Rebooted phone

reboot

- Created conf for wpa_supplicant

$ wpa_passphrase "SSID" "password" > wifi

- connect to wifi AP

$ sudo wpa_supplicant -i wlan0 -c wifi

- get ip address from dhcp server

$ sudo udhcpc -i wlan0

PR (https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/514) to include necessary firmware. Not yet properly tested.
