=== Wifi ===

''Please edit this to match the style of wiki.''

I got wifi working on gt-i9100 with following procedure:

- Created path /system/etc/wifi

mkdir -p /system/etc/wifi

- Downloaded firmware files from https://github.com/TheMuppets/proprietary_vendor_samsung/tree/cm-14.1/i9100/proprietary/system/etc/wifi and saved to /system/etc/wifi

- Rebooted phone

reboot

- Created conf for wpa_supplicant

$ wpa_passphrase "SSID" "password" > wifi

- connect to wifi AP

$ sudo wpa_supplicant -i wlan0 -c wifi

- get ip address from dhcp server

$ sudo udhcpc -i wlan0
