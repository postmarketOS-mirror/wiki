=== What works ===

* Installation to sdcard (<code>pmbootstrap install --sdcard=/dev/mmcblk...</code>)
* Installation to device memory (partial)
* Touchscreen
* Weston (only on SD card)
* XWayland

=== What does not work ===

* The rest (Wifi, bluetooth, making calls, ...)
* Auto resizing partitions during installation to device memory (probably)

=== How to enter flash mode ===

'''For i9100'''
* Connect a USB cable
* Make sure, the device is powered off
* Hold power + volume down
* As soon, as the samsung logo appears on the screen, only press volume down

'''For d710'''
* Connect a USB cable
* Make sure, the device is powered off
* Hold power + volume down
* When prompted, release all buttons and press volume up

=== Installation ===

Flashing to device memory uses [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/456 drebrez's netcat method (#456)].

Init pmbootstrap. Make sure to choose ''none'' for the user interface instead of ''weston'' because ''weston'' makes the image just a little bit too large for the unresized partition.

<source lang="shell">$ ./pmbootstrap.py init</source>

Start the build process

<source lang="shell">$ ./pmbootstrap.py install</source>

Flash postmarketOS to the device:

https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/456

For the d710, on step 5 use ''/dev/mmcblk0p11'' as the install partition.

On step 8, use <source lang="shell">pv /home/user/rootfs/samsung-i9100.img | nc 172.16.42.1 60000</source> instead.

=== Boot process ===

We're using the <code>heimdall-isorec</code> flash method, see [[deviceinfo_flash_methods]] for more information.

=== Wifi ===

''Please edit this to match the style of wiki.''

I got wifi working on gt-i9100 with following procedure:

- Created path /system/etc/wifi

mkdir -p /system/etc/wifi

- Downloaded firmware files from https://github.com/TheMuppets/proprietary_vendor_samsung/tree/cm-14.1/i9100/proprietary/system/etc/wifi and saved to /system/etc/wifi

- Rebooted phone

reboot

- Created conf for wpa_supplicant

$ wpa_passphrase "SSID" "password" > wifi

- connect to wifi AP

$ sudo wpa_supplicant -i wlan0 -c wifi

- get ip address from dhcp server

$ sudo udhcpc -i wlan0

PR (https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/514) to include necessary firmware. Not yet properly tested.
