== What works ==

* u-boot from mainline, installed on sd card
* loading a kernel/initrd from the sd card

== What doesn't work ==

* The kernel, the linux-postmarketos-stable needs a few items enabled to create the dtb file for the inet1, with that it should have graphcis

== Boot process ==

The Alwinner A10 (and A13) support booting from an SD card, with SD booting it checks for an executable spl at sector 8 of the inserted SD card (like bios with an MBR bootsector). Mainline u-boot can be
configured to compile u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin, this file can be written to the SD card at sector 8 with `dd`

dd if=u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/sdc bs=1024 seek=8

If this SD card is inserted in the tablet then it will execute u-boot from the SD card instead of the built-in alwinner bootloader, skipping all vendor code. This u-boot should load boot.scr from the first partition of the SD card which can be ext2, ext4 or fat. The boot.scr will load the kernel uimage and the initramfs from the boot partition on the sd card.
