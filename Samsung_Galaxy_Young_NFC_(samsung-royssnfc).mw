== How to enter flash mode ==
Press and hold Home + Volume DOWN + Power until confirmation dialog appear, then press Volume UP to confirm.

== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. WiFi, photos, ... -->
See [[Installation_guide|Installation guide]].

== What works ==
* Booting
* USB Networking + SSH
* Flashing
* Touchscreen
* SD Card installation

== What does not work ==
* Staying on without rebooting after around one minute. (You can see XFCE booting, but not use it before it reboots...)

== Not tested ==
* Everything that implies staying on.

== Issues ==
* Reboots every 1 minute after boot (probably a watchdog somewhere ?)

== Plans ==
* Try with a different DM
* Take a look at the kernel options
* Try other kernels
