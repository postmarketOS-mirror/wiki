== How to enter flash mode ==

Appears to be the same story as for other Wiko devices with MediaTek chipset. Fastboot is broken, it doesn't boot anything at the moment, so I might have to use SP Flash Tool.

Looks very similar to Wiko U FEEL in terms of specification, although I'm claiming that the architecture is aarch64 and they're saying it's armhf. I'm not really sure,
Cortex-A53 is a 64-bit processor from what I can tell.

== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->

Installing doesn't work with fastboot, because the file is too large. I tried installing on an external SD card, but it's still not booting.
