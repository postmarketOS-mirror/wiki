== Users owning this device ==
Kept this block as code, to prevent device auto-listing 
<syntaxhighlight>{{Device owners}}</syntaxhighlight>

== How to enter flash mode ==
=== Bootloader Unlocking ===
Like other Xiaomi devices, the user will have to acquire the bootloader unlock key: https://en.miui.com/unlock

The device will not unlock if the device isn't 7 days old (from the time when your device connects to internet and powered on, and linked with Mi Account)

=== Recovery mode ===
* Turn the device off (or restart also works)
* Hold both volume buttons (+ and -) and power button
* Keep holding until you got to recovery.

=== Flashing (Download, Fastboot) mode ===
* Same as recovery, but this time hold the volume down key instead of both keys.

== Installation ==
Should be as usual for fastboot devices

== Additional info ==

=== Android Verified Boot (vbmeta) ===
This device is using '''Android Verified Boot''' ( https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/avb/+/refs/tags/android-vts-8.0_r11/README.md ) so you may need to flash <code>vbmeta</code> partition with <code>vbmeta.img</code> from LineageOS zip or downloaded separately (from https://androidfilehost.com/?fid=1395089523397954291 for example); or we need to find a way to generate it with <code>avbtool</code> and flash it during installation somehow. (add <code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_vbmeta</code>?)

=== DTBO partition ===
This device is using a dedicated partition to store the [[Device_Tree_(dtb)|Device Tree Blob]] Overlay. Read more at https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/dto/partitions . We need to find a way to flash generated <code>dt.img</code> to <code>dtbo</code> partition during installation process. (add <code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_dtbo</code>?)
