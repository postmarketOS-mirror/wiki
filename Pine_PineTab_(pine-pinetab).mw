== Serial console ==
The PineTab has a serial port in the headphone connector, it's activated by a switch behind the SD card cover. If the switch is pointed toward the SD card the headphone connector is in audio mode, if it's pointed the other way it's in UART mode.

The uart is 115200n8

The pinout for the serial connector on the tablet side is:

* Tip: RX
* Ring: TX
* Sleeve: GND

The serial connection is 3.3V

You can also buy the debug cable from [https://store.pine64.org PINE64 Store]

=== Touchscreen ===

The touchscreen on the PineTab is controlled by <code>goodix</code> module on i2c-0. Currently on some units, the touchscreen does not work due to the driver requires both "irq" and "reset" GPIOs to send the reset. Otherwise the touchscreen will be at 0x14 instead of 0x5d, [https://gitlab.com/pine64-org/linux/merge_requests/9 this pull request should fix it].

=== Cameras ===
Both front and back camera shares the same csi-0 bus. Currently only the back camera (OV5640) has mainline support.

It's not clear what would it reacts to both front and back camera. ''[citation needed]''

Since Cerdus is at <code>/dev/video0</code>, the CSI is at <code>/dev/video1</code> and can be controlled with <code>/dev/media1</code> using <code>media-ctl</code>

=== Wi-Fi ===
Wi-Fi works using the [https://github.com/Icenowy/rtl8723cs RTL8723CS driver from Icenowy], loads and connect to a Wi-Fi perfectly fine. However power saving capabilities aren't working, so the PineTab battery will drain more quicker.

=== Bluetooth ===
Bluetooth also works on this device after installing <code>firmware-rtl8723bt</code>, there is a patch series on LKML.
