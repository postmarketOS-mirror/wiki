== How to enter flash mode ==
Hold volume down while powering on the device. Release power once you see anything on screen.


== Installation ==
This device has only been tested with rootfs on sd card, booted via USB with 'pmbootstrap flasher boot'.

You will need an unlocked bootloader. You can follow the instructions on [https://support.motorola.com/us/en/bootloader/unlockyourdeviceb Motorola's website] to do this.

== Touchscreen ==

Touch panel is from from Focaltech, but does not seem to be supported by CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_EDT_FT5X06. Downstream stock rom's kernel uses an out-of-tree module called focaltech_mmi to support the touch panel.

== Wifi ==

Wireless seems to be a new generation of atheros not supported by the existing CNSS/QCA in-kernel driver. Downstream stock rom's kernel uses an out-of-tree module called qca_cld3_wlan.
