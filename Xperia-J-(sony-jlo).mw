== What works ==
* Nothing.

== What does not work ==
* Everything!

== To test/do ==
* Figure out the bootimg format and make the phone boot.
* Get everything else working.

== How to enter flash mode ==
When the device is powered off, press '''Volume Up''' while plugging in a microUSB cable to enter fastboot.
Nothing will be displayed on the screen when this occurs.

== Installation ==
Can be flashed normally, but it will not boot atm, see below.

== Booting ==
* The Sony Xperia J along with some other 2012/13 Xperia phones (such as its previously attempted sister device [[Sony_Xperia_E_Dual_(sony-nanhu)|Xperia E]] use a ''notoriously'' difficult (to use and generate properly) ELF format for boot images, which we can't generate bootable versions of right now.
* Rudimentary support for these formats have been [https://github.com/WilliamO7/pmbootstrap/tree/device-sony-jlo added] and [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1074 requested] for inclusion into upstream.
* One thing of note is that the FreeXperia project (now defunct) got a working CM/LOS10 build on this phone (used at the time of testing) and has quite an interesting init script to allow for using LEDs and recovery - the ROM can be downloaded from [http://uploaded.net/file/esw1wzun/from/59w3fb here] if you want to research further (sorry for restrictive host.)
