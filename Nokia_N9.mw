This device is pretty similar to nokia N950, with minor differences in kernel. Bootloader has same problems.  https://elinux.org/N950


Filippz did some initial porting, at https://github.com/filippz/pmbootstrap/


Kernel can be started without flashing, using:

```
sudo /data/l/maemo/0xffff/src/0xFFFF -m kernel:vmlinuz-nokia-n9-dtb -m initfs:initramfs-nokia-n9 -l -b
```
