== How to enter flash mode ==
Download mode: VolDown while powering on

Recovery mode: VolUp while powering on

== Installation ==
* First make a zip with <code>pmbootstrap install --android-recovery-zip</code>. 
* Boot in to the TWRP recovery
* Click on "Advanced" -> "ADB Sideload", then "Swipe to Start Sideload"
* Connect your tablet to your PC
* Start the sideloading process from your PC:

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap flasher --method=adb sideload
</syntaxhighlight>


If you don't have TWRP, you can try to flash the system with <code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs</code>.

== USB OTG ==
USB OTG should work out of the box. To use keyboards and mice, do <code>sudo apk add xf86-input-keyboard xf86-input-mouse</code>

== Notes/To Do ==
The Tab 3 8.0 has the same chipset as the [[Samsung_Galaxy_SIII_LTE_(samsung-i9305)]] (Exynos 4412), but the SIII uses a Quad variant. 

Only lt01wifi/T310 has been tested so far. I might make builds for T311 and T315 once I get T310 working.

<b>XFCE ONLY:</b>The device indicates when it's charging, but the actual batery percentage readings don't work.

Hardware buttons work, they just require triggerhappy on xfce. Back and menu buttons are in <code>/dev/input/event1</code>, home, volume and power buttons are in <code>/dev/input/event0</code>.

Audio should work using [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Audio#WM1811 these instructions]. The tablet uses TAB3_WM1811 as the name.
