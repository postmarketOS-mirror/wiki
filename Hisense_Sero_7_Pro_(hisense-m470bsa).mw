=== Known issues ===
* Flash fails on both system and user partition due to there not being enough space, use a micro sd card or try making a smaller system image if you have this issue.
* Audio not working right now, hoping to fix soon.
* No Hardware Acceleration!
* Framebuffer locked to portrait mode (could probably be fixed by rotating it in the xorg config)
