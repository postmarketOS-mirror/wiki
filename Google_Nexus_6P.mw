* zhuowei

== What works ==

* Building kernel
* Booting kernel via fastboot
* Telnet to initramfs, ssh to running system
* Mounting rootfs via NFS over USB (needs the [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/547 nfs-root PR])
* Touchscreen
* Wi-Fi: Follow [[Wifi#Connecting_to_APs]] to enable; currently using outdated firmware from upstream linux-firmware package

== What does not work ==

* Splash image
* Graphics: Screen will only work if you [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/66 run in the background]
<pre>while [ ! ]; do cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/modes > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/mode; done</pre>
* Mounting rootfs on internal storage (untested)
* Everything else (no Bluetooth, audio, modem, accelerometer, you tell me)

== Kernel configs applied ==

Configs changed from stock Lineage kernel:
* [[Kernel_configuration#CONFIG_DEVTMPFS | CONFIG_DEVTMPFS]]=y
* [[Kernel_configuration#CONFIG_VT | CONFIG_VT]]=y
* CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=y
* Various NFS client configs: CONFIG_NFS_V4_1=y
* [[Kernel_configuration#CONFIG_MSM_KGSL | CONFIG_MSM_KGSL]]=n
* CONFIG_BCMDHD_FW_PATH, CONFIG_BCMDHD_NVRAM_PATH

== How to enter flash mode ==

The Nexus 6P, like all Google Nexus devices, uses Fastboot as the flashing protocol.

To enter Fastboot mode, hold Volume Down while powering on the device. Let go of Volume Down when a picture of a green Android mascot shows up on the screen.
