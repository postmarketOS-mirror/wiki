== What works ==

* Compiling the kernel from the Jolla sources which should provide everything to run Wayland since that's what Sailfish uses
* Flashing
* Booting
* USB
* SSH (after some manual configuration)

== Flashing mode ==

The Jolla phone uses fastboot from the Mer project rather than Android. To enter fastboot shut down the device, then plug in the USB lead while holding down volume down.

== USB connection ==

The USB connection works, but needs some manual configuration (as found [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/USB_Network#Assigning_an_IP_address here]).

First, find the interface name using <code>ip a</code>.
Then, we have to assign the device a mac address (replace the interface name with what you found from the previous command).
<source>
# ip l set enp1s0f0u3: address 12:12:12:12:12:12
</source>

Lastly, add an IP address.

<source>
# ip address add dev enp1s0f0u3 172.16.42.2/24
</source>

You can now use SSH to connect to the device on <code>172.16.42.1</code>.
