* MartijnBraam

== What works ==

* Compiling the kernel from the Jolla sources which should provide everything to run Wayland since that's what Sailfish uses
* Booting
* USB
* SSH (after some manual configuration)

== What does not work ==

* Flashing, still need to find the correct offsets

== Flashing mode ==

The Jolla phone uses fastboot from the Mer project rather than Android. To enter fastboot shut down the device, then plug in the USB lead while holding down volume down.
