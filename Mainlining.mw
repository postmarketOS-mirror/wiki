[[Category:Socs]]
Mainlining is the process of replacing the kernel provided by the device vendor (the "downstream" kernel), with a version close to the actively developed version released on [https://www.kernel.org kernel.org] (the "mainline" kernel). It involves porting (and most importantly: cleaning up) device-specific code from the downstream kernel to the mainline kernel. For some [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip SoCs], common support already exists in mainline, so you can focus on device-specific components.

== Why? ==
Mainlining is a fairly complicated process, especially if you're one of the first to start work on a given SoC. However through community effort there is a growing number of SoCs that have increasingly stable mainline ports (see below). In general it is relatively simple to take your existing Android kernel and boot it without any of the Android blobs, however from that point it can be a lot of working to create a working system and at the end of it you don't receive any security patches or general improvements.

Apart from purely practical insufficiencies, the cold hard truth is that the downstream code is simply not meant to be maintained or get used outside Android. The code quality is often several magnitudes worse, which makes maintenance rather complicated. Often large parts of the drivers are moved into proprietary parts in Android userspace - which are generally impossible to use without emulating the expected Android environment. At the end, the effort to make such drivers work properly on long term is often as much as rewriting them properly for mainline.

Successfully mainlining an SoC or device means that you benefit from every improvement the Linux kernel has to offer, you can run a fairly standard Linux distro (in theory even ''any'' Linux distro) and benefit from kernel updates and improvements without needing to compile your own kernel or deal with frustrating patches. A notable easy-to-notice benefit of running mainline is minimal-effort-needed GPU support for almost all GPUs (except PowerVR unfortunately), which is needed for using modern phone DEs like Plasma Mobile or Phosh with acceptable performance. Lastly, mainlining is a terrific learning opportunity that you will never regret.

If your device's SoC is in the list below there's a very decent chance that you can get the same functionality working on your device and eventually upstream your patches to the kernel, helping to build a solid base for other devices too!

== Overview ==

=== Supported SoCs ===
Some SoCs are already supported quite well and are used for some devices in postmarketOS. Getting started with one of these might be easier for you, because you can get help from others working with the same SoC. The feature matrix below shows which features are already supported for a particular SoC. The pages for each SoC will provide more information, plus hints how to get started and who you can contact.

* '''CPU:''' SMP (bring up secondary CPU cores), CPU frequency scaling, CPUidle
* '''Storage:''' eMMC, SD cards, UFS, ...
* '''Video:''' Hardware-accelerated video de/encoding
* '''Modem:''' Calls, SMS, Internet
* Unavailable (-) means that such a feature is not built directly into SoC. For example, WiFi/BT are also often used through SDIO/UART which can be chosen independently from the SoC.
'''Note:''' The statuses displayed below signify if a particular feature was tested on a device by someone in the postmarketOS community - not necessarily the components supported in the mainline kernel.

=== Getting help ===
Mainlining related to postmarketOS is primarily discussed in the [[Matrix_and_IRC|#postmarketOS-mainline]] channel. For one of the SoCs above there should be someone around who is able to help you to some extent. Note that you will be on your own for some of the problems - there are often device specific problems or components that no one has experience with yet.

Below are some more chat channels / mailing list that may be helpful for further help or if you want to work on a SoC that is not listed above (yet!):

== Getting Started ==
* Collect as much information about your device as you can: downstream kernel sources, specifications, schematics (can be sometimes found with your favorite search engine) are all going to prove invaluable when attempting to port a device to mainline.
* [[Serial debugging]] will be helpful especially in the beginning (before USB or network is working). Some devices expose it through the USB port or the audio jack; others have test points available on the mainboard.
* Choose a kernel tree:
** '''Mainline:''' (the last kernel version released by Linus Torvalds) Usually a good compromise of being recent, yet quite stable. [https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git torvalds/linux.git]
** '''linux-next:''' A collection of recently merged changes from many subsystems; use this if you are working on a very recent SoC. [https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git next/linux-next.git]
** There may be more WIP changes available in Linux kernel trees specific to your SoC.
* [[Compiling kernels with envkernel.sh]] is very useful to integrate kernel development into postmarketOS.
* If you are attempting to port to a SoC listed above, check the SoC wiki page for further help and instructions.
* Do not attempt to copy any code as-is from downstream. In general this won't work, and most importantly: it won't be accepted for inclusion into the mainline kernel upstream.
** Instead, try to understand what the downstream code does, and rewrite it from scratch for mainline by looking at similar code.
