== How to enter flash mode ==
When the device is fully powered off, hold Power, Volume Down and Home for a few seconds.

A (turquoise) download mode warning screen should appear, press Volume Up to confirm.

== Installation ==
It is recommended to sideload an android recovery zip through TWRP for the easiest process, since heimdall freaks out about the subpartitions in SYSTEM and won't move past ~7%.
You can use <code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</code> and then use netcat or similar to flash SYSTEM, but this is a longer and more redundant method.

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap install --android-recovery-zip
$ pmbootstrap flasher --method=adb sideload
</syntaxhighlight>
