== General description ==
[https://www.qualcomm.com/products/sdm660 SDM660]/636/[https://fccid.io/PY7-67442A/Schematics/Schematics-20171116-v1-PY7-67442A-Schematic-Diagram-3652761 630] are Qualcomm SoCs released in 2017, with mostly out-of-tree mainline support.

According to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Qualcomm_Snapdragon_systems-on-chip#Snapdragon_630,_636_and_660_(2017) Wikipedia], they all are pretty similar. Their advantage is price; these SoCs are usually used in middle-range devices.

Closest similar SoC is [[Qualcomm_Snapdragon_835_(MSM8998)|MSM8998 Snapdragon 835]] (which has decent mainline support), and it seems that several drivers from [[Qualcomm_Snapdragon_835_(MSM8998)|MSM8998]] can be reused for SDM660.

Main problem of the platform is missing a proper PMIC support (PM660/PM660L) which is required for voltage scaling support. Currently we have to get by with whatever the bootloader gave us.

== Battery/Charging == 
Most devices seem to use the PMIC-provided QPNP-charger which currently does not have a mainline driver.

== CPU ==
All cores are up, PSCI is working. Marked as partial because there is no support for CPU frequency scaling.

== Display ==
At least four 630 boards can successfully use display (both command- and video-mode) via DRM/MSM (and of course CPU rendering) with some (for now) out-of-tree patches.
Most devices make use of PMIC-provided WLED backlight, which does have a mainline driver, but there happens to be an issue with it not working.

== GPU ==
Adreno 508-512 are not supported in the mainline kernel yet.

== Modem Subsystem ==
The remote processor responsible for modem subsystem shows up and shows *some* signs of life, but neither the modem itself, nor the Wi-Fi chip currently work. The phone also gets very hot with it enabled, which might suggest it's not really fine right now. Of course it needs firmware.

== Pinctrl ==
Was ported from downstream kernel to mainline by [[User:opendata|opendata]] in 2018.

== SMMUs / IOMMUs ==
This platform is very picky about its SMMUs and therefore requires many downstream workarounds to be implemented. Upstream maintainers aren't exactly happy with that.

== Storage ==
At least SDHCI (eMMC) was tested to work. UFS is untested (if anybody knows about a sdm630/36/60-based device using UFS, leave a note here!).

== USB ==
There is WIP support for USB 2.0 only (no USB 3) by [[User:Konradybcio|Konrad Dybcio]] in https://github.com/konradybcio/linux/commits/ninges_labs

Do note that most devices only have USB 2.0 wired up in hardware.

== WiFi ==
Wireless network should be available via the ath10k_snoc driver, provided the modem subsystem is alive. It also needs firmware (which is possibly signed per-device or per-vendor - though it's unconfirmed!).

== Work done so far ==
=== Who is working on it ===
* [[User:opendata]] worked on initial basic SoC support (pinctrl-sdm660, gcc-sdm660) (+ [https://gitlab.com/opendata26/linux/-/tree/nile-mainline-submit-2 various branches])
* [https://developer.sony.com/posts/pavel-dubrova-selected-as-the-first-2018-hero-open-source-developer/ Pavel Dubrova] worked on SDM630 SoC support based on kernel 5.3. It is unknown where the sources are located.
* [[User:Alexeymin]] tried to continue opendata's work.  WIP Branch is in [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/linux-postmarketos/-/commits/qcom-sdm660/ linux-postmarketos] repo.
* [[User:Konradybcio|Konrad Dybcio]] in https://github.com/konradybcio/linux/commits/ninges_labs (warning: frequent forcepushes!)
