== General description ==
[https://www.qualcomm.com/products/sdm660 SDM660]/636/[https://fccid.io/PY7-67442A/Schematics/Schematics-20171116-v1-PY7-67442A-Schematic-Diagram-3652761 630] are Qualcomm SoCs released in 2017, with practically no mainline support.
According to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Qualcomm_Snapdragon_systems-on-chip#Snapdragon_630,_636_and_660_(2017) Wikipedia], they all are pretty similar. Their advantage is price; SoC is usually used in middle-range priced devices, compared to SDM845-based devices, which are usually expensive and used in high-end hardware.

Closest similar SoC is [[Qualcomm_Snapdragon_835_(MSM8998)|MSM8998 Snapdragon 835]] (which has decent mainline support), and it seems that several drivers from [[Qualcomm_Snapdragon_835_(MSM8998)|MSM8998]] can be reused for SDM660.

Main problem of the platform is missing a proper PMIC support (PM660/PM660L) which is required for working on almost every other component.

== CPU ==
All cores are up, PSCI is working. Marked as partial because there is no support for CPU frequency scaling.

== Storage ==
At least SDHCI (eMMC) was tested to work. UFS is untested (xiaomi-lavender does not have it).

== USB ==
Should work similarly to [[Qualcomm_Snapdragon_835_(MSM8998)|MSM8998]]. There is WIP support for USB 2.0 only (no USB 3) by [[User:Konradybcio|Konrad Dybcio]] in https://github.com/konradybcio/linux/commits/ninges_labs

== Display ==
At least one 630 board can successfully use display via DRM/MSM with some (for now) out-of-tree patches.

== GPU ==
Adreno 508-512 are not suppored in the mainline kernel yet.

== Pinctrl ==
Was ported from downstream kernel to mainline by [[User:opendata|opendata]] in 2018.

== WiFi ==
Driver is there (ath10k_snoc) and should work the same way as in [[Qualcomm_Snapdragon_845_(SDM845)|SDM845]]/[[Qualcomm_Snapdragon_835_(MSM8998)|MSM8998]] and such. See their pages for details.

== Work done so far ==
=== Who is working on it ===
* [[User:opendata]] worked on initial basic SoC support (pinctrl-sdm660, gcc-sdm660) (+ [https://gitlab.com/opendata26/linux/-/tree/nile-mainline-submit-2 various branches])
* [https://developer.sony.com/posts/pavel-dubrova-selected-as-the-first-2018-hero-open-source-developer/ Pavel Dubrova] worked on SDM630 SoC support based on kernel 5.3. It is unknown where the sources are located.
* [[User:Alexeymin]] tried to continue opendata's work.  WIP Branch is in [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/linux-postmarketos/-/commits/qcom-sdm660/ linux-postmarketos] repo.
