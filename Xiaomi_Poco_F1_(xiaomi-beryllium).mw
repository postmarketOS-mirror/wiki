== How to enter flash mode ==
You have to press Power and Vol- to enter the bootloader.

== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->

Download the device/linux package from my GitHub or from the GitLab MR (because it is not merged) and paste it into your pmaports/device folder.

Choose Plasma Mobile as user interface (others do not work yet).

Build and install it.

You can also use mainline kernel with envkernel, but only USB and panel works with mainline yet.

Downstream and mainline are pretty much at the same state.

Works with mainline: USB, panel (with HW acceleration), Volume-Up

Works with downstream: USB, panel, touchscreen, (keys?)
