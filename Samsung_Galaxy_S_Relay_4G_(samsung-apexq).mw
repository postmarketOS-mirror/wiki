You will need to do this twice during the flashing step.

Set phone to ODIN mode

  1. Turn off phone
  2. Connect USB cable
  3. Hold VOLUME_DOWN + HOME + POWER until you get Warning!! screen
  4. Push VOLUME_UP to continue to ODIN mode screen
<pre>
./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_kernel
</pre>
Phone will reboot. Follow above instructions again. It's easiest to just hold volddown and home while the kernel progress is shown instead of powering off in between flashes.
<pre>
./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_rootfs
</pre>
The device will then reboot into postmarketos
