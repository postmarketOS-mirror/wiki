== How to enter flash mode ==
The device has to be with unlocked bootloader. Android phone version has bootloader locked by default.
Locked bootloader may be unlocked with a Beta FlymeOS image for the international phone version.
International firmware can be flashed to Chinese phone if one changes phone's id (possible with a 5.1.x
Chinese firmware, root and a hex editor).


Press volume down and power while turning on to get into fastboot mode.

== Installation ==
Current pmbootstrap utility assumes that boot partition is always named 'boot' on fastboot devices.
This device's boot partition has 'bootimg' label. Because of that boot partition must be either
flashed directly with fastboot utility, or pmbootstrap config source code has to be fixed.

== Status ==
Currently when turned on, the device enters reboot loop.
USB networking workds, telnet debugging hook lets log in at early stage before the reboot.
All steps from init.sh until switch_root when entered manually in telnet debug shell seem to work without problem.
The display is not working - blank black screen. If provoked to display an early splash (e.g. no rootfs), a black image is displayed
with white lines on the left and top borders, as if it is a part of zoomed in image.
