== How to enter flash mode ==
The device has to be with unlocked bootloader. Android phone version has bootloader locked by default.
Locked bootloader may be unlocked with a Beta FlymeOS image for the international phone version.
International firmware can be flashed to Chinese phone if one changes phone's id (possible with a 5.1.x
Chinese firmware, root and a hex editor).


Press volume down and power while turning on to get into fastboot mode.

== Installation ==
Current pmbootstrap utility assumes that boot partition is always named 'boot' on fastboot devices.
This device's boot partition has 'bootimg' label. Because of that boot partition must be either
flashed directly with fastboot utility, or pmbootstrap config source code has to be fixed.

== Status ==
Currently when turned on, the device enters reboot loop. The reboot is triggered by the line:

'''
 udevadm trigger --type=devices --action=add
'''
The device is accessible with telnet hook and via SSH (after additional procedure)

In order to workaround this problem you can compile a custom eudev package with this patch:
https://github.com/elelel/eudev/commit/f27656ae371c0da23346cdccbd3dc28cf38d2794
...and install it on the system

Current aport does not contain firmware blobs. Adding them might fix the eudev problem.

=== Getting device to boot in spite of uedev ===

Install PostmarketOS's telnet debug hook, log on with telnet, then  execute:

 . init_functions.sh
 mount_boot_partition
 extract_initramfs_extra /boot/initramfs-*-extra
 start_charging_mode
 wait_root_partition
 resize_root_partition
 unlock_root_partition
 resize_root_filesystem
 mount_root_partition
 mount -o remount,rw /dev/mapper/sda41p2 /sysroot

 mount -t proc proc /sysroot/proc
 mount -t sysfs sys /sysroot/sys
 chroot /sysroot


If you want just to boot to SSH, in chroot, comment out the offendig string, e.g. with sed replace or vi in /etc/init.d/udev-trigger.rc

'''
 udevadm trigger --type=devices --action=add
'''

If you want to make the device boot to UI as normal, you should install patched eudev package (see above) at this point and reboot.

== Development notes ==
=== Kernels ===
There are several candidate kernels for the port:

# Official kernel sources
## [https://github.com/meizuosc/m576/tree/master Android branch]. This branch seem to contain the very first kernel used for the earliest FlymeOS 4.x ROM. It is reported to be uncomplete, in particular, it misses Meizu proprietary sources for power management.
## [https://github.com/meizuosc/m576/tree/ubuntu Ubuntu branch]. This branch seem to contain kernell for Android release updated to 3.10.100 in commit f866ad068f11fb5e68ff87901346483945972ae9. After that Ubuntu-specific patches as well as generic bugfixes come.
## Android 7 kernel, not released. Kernels from previous two links were only used in very early official ROMs. Later kernel sources were not realeased. There is a Github [https://github.com/meizuosc/m576/issues/5 issue] requesting the release. Meizu is known to respond positively to such issues.
# Unofficial sources
## [https://github.com/ubports/kernel_turbo UBPorts kernel]. Based on Meizu Pro 5 branch. Contains Ubuntu Touch fixes and ports, mainly Android binder and anbox-specific patches.
## [https://github.com/faust93/kernel_meizu_m576 faust93's kernel]. Kernel used in at least two unofficial Android roms. This kernel, probably based on CM14.1, seems to be most up to date candidate, but contains a lot of patches from assorted sources and may be not very stable
