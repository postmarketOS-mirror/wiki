== How to enter flash mode ==
The device has to be with unlocked bootloader. Android phone version has bootloader locked by default.
Locked bootloader may be unlocked with a Beta FlymeOS image for the international phone version.
International firmware can be flashed to Chinese phone if one changes phone's id (possible with a 5.1.x
Chinese firmware, root and a hex editor).


Press volume down and power while turning on to get into fastboot mode.

== Installation ==
Current pmbootstrap utility assumes that boot partition is always named 'boot' on fastboot devices.
This device's boot partition has 'bootimg' label. Because of that boot partition must be either
flashed directly with fastboot utility, or pmbootstrap config source code has to be fixed.

At the time of writing the device boots, but is unable to insert subpartitions from 'system' partition
into kernel. kpartx -avs /dev/sda41 sees the partition table, but each subpartition inside appears to be
corrupt. USB networking workds, telnet debugging hook lets log in at early stage before root is mounted.
