Nothing yet

== What does not work ==

== How to enter flash mode ==
You can enter flash mode with {{Button|Power}} + {{Button|Volume Up}} or {{Button|Power}} + {{Button|Volume Down}} after installing the SDE bootmenu

== Installation ==

=== Installing SDE bootmenu ===
The first step is installing SDE bootmenu so you'll be able to actually flash non-archos software to the device. This will void your warranty!

# Power on the tablet while holding the {{Button|Volume Down}} button, release the {{Button|Power}} button as soon as the archos logo shows up but hold the {{Button|Volume Down}} button.
# Choose "Update Firmware" with the {{Button|Volume Up}} and {{Button|Volume Down}} buttons and press the {{Button|Power}} button to accept
# The device now shows up as an empty mass storage device, mount the device and download the [http://update.archos.com/9/gen9/gen9_sde/firmware_archos_it4.aos SDE bootmenu image] to it.
# Unmount the mass storage device and press the power button again on the device to install

=== Flashing the kernel and initramfs ===
After installing SDE bootmenu you can install the kernel and initramfs. This is also done through a mass storage device.

# Power on the tablet while holding {{Button|Volume Down}}
# Select "Developer Edition Menu"
# The first time you flash a kernel you'll have to remove the android kernel since the bootloader will default to that kernel over your custom developer kernel.
# Select "Flash Kernel and Initramfs"
# Mount the mass storage device that just appeared
