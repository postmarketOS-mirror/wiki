== What works ==
Flashing kernel (flashing rootfs and twrp-recovery-zip are not tested).
== How to enter flash mode ==
Hold Power key and Vol- just after that. Release buttons when logo appears. Navigate to "Reboot to bootloader" option with volume keys and press Power to choose. The phone will reboot in fastboot mode.
Another option is to connect phone to computer and run
<source>$ adb reboot bootloader</source>
or
<source>$ sudo fastboot reboot bootloader</source>

== Installation ==
=== Flashing kernel ===
{{note|'''Backup your boot partition before flashing kernel.''' If you have root, you can do it with adb. Connect phone to computer, enable USB debugging in Developer mode. Then
<source>$ adb shell
$ su
# dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk0p16 of=/sdcard/boot.img</source>
If the phone isn't rooted, use ResearchDownload tool for backup.}}

Fastboot on this phone doesn't support booting kernel from SD card, so it's required to flash kernel with <code>$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</code>
If you have SD card that is rather fast, consider to not flash rootfs on the phone, because its memory is probably slower (15 Mb/s on read, 9 Mb/s on write).
