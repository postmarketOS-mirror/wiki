== Notes ==
This is an active work in progress, which you can view/contribute to here: https://github.com/jkayani/pmbootstrap/tree/device-samsung-t679

You can view the original kernel sources for the device here: https://github.com/jkayani/exhibit-kernel. I originally obtained them from here (thanks Jocala!): https://github.com/Jocala/Samsung-Exhibit-II-Kernel, but had to put them in my own repo so that the source was in the root.
