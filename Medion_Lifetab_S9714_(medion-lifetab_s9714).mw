== How to enter flash mode ==

To start fastboot mode:
# boot into recovery by holding volume-down while starting the device, then
# <code>adb reboot bootloader</code>

To unlock bootloader in fastboot mode (CAUTION: this will erase userdata! Backup before doing this!): <code>fastboot oem unlock</code>

== Installation ==

My procedure was:
# Backup all important user data
# Unlock bootloader (see above)
# Install [https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-Android-based-Tablets-and/A2109-Updated-ClockworkMod-Recovery-for-Jelly-Bean/td-p/949575 CWM recovery] by going into fastboot mode and then running <code>fastboot flash recovery A2109_CWMrecovery-6.0.1.9d.img</code>
# Backup Android installation on SD card
# [[Installation_guide|Follow installation guide]]
