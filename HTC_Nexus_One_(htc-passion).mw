While powering on, hold trackball plus volume-up.

== Port Status ==

Code is at https://github.com/scintill/pmbootstrap/tree/device/htc-passion .

Code should be cleaned up. Notably, I backported gcc 4 because the kernel compiled with gcc 6 doesn't boot. It's a bit Frankensteinish and not ideal, so it would be good to figure out how to get it working with gcc 6.
