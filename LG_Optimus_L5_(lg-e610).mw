== How to enter flash mode ==
From off state, press and hold Volume UP + Power + Home, then release Power and hold the other two.

The phone will stay on the LG logo and show a black log screen once you connect the USB cable.

== Internal memory Installation ==
Both commands
  $ pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs
  $ pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs --partition userdata
Fail with:
  [12:50:20] (native) flash rootfs image
  target didn't report max-download-size
  Sending 'userdata' (464896 KB)...
  FAILED (remote: data too large)

SD card installation is recommended

== SD card Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->

- Build image (on your computer) and prepare the installation as usual

  $ pmbootstrap init
  $ pmbootstrap build device-lg-e610
  $ pmbootstrap install --no-fde --sdcard=/dev/mmcblk0

- Put the phone in Fastboot mode and connect it to your computer

  $ pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel
