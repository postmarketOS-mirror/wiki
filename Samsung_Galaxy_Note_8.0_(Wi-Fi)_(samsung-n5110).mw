== Contributors ==

== Maintainer(s) ==
* michitux

== What works ==

* Weston including touch
* Xfce4 (recommended) including touch and pen
* WiFi using the <code>firmware-samsung-i9305</code> - but: NetworkManager does not work, see https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/1461
* Bluetooth works partially as described for the [[Samsung_Galaxy_SIII_I747_(samsung-i747m)#Bluetooth|Galaxy SIII]] but the device is <code>/dev/ttySAC0</code>
* Audio, see [[Audio#WM1811]] for more instructions. Both an pre-configured saved state as well as the ucm profiles are included.
* charging-sdl

== What does not work ==

* Bluetooth pairing with bluez5 (bluez4 is working, more on that soon)
* [[osk-sdl]] - FDE most likely does not work as some kernel options are missing (can be easily fixed probably if FDE is desired).
* GPS
* Camera
* Sleep etc.
* poweroff on shutdown (<code>halt</code>) command - make sure you really turn the device off or your battery will be totally depleted.
* 3D acceleration (plasma mobile is very slow)

== How to enter flash mode ==

Hold power and volume down simultaneously.

== Installation ==

Flashing of the kernel works with heimdall, installation on the system partition works at least with <code>adb sideload</code> using TWRP (did not try heimdall). Installation on the sdcard should work, too (untested).

<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->

== Mainline Kernel ==
There is currently no mainline kernel available but it should be possible to mainline this device. Have a look at [http://blog.forkwhiletrue.me/pages/midas-mainline/ Midas on Mainline] for work on mainlining very similar devices.
Replicant is also interested in mainlining this device and replacing the bootloader with u-boot and would like to collaborate with us [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1219#issuecomment-395876420].
