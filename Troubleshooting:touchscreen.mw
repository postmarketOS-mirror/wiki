= Generic debugging steps =

== Test with evtest ==

You can test if the touchscreen emits any events with <code>evtest</code>.

== Test with libinput debug-events ==

You can check if libinput understands the events your touchscreen driver emits with <code>libinput debug-events</code>.

For example it's possible that libinput doesn't get any events or that it doesn't get TOUCH_DOWN/TOUCH_UP events. You can see the raw events libinput receives with <code>libinput record</code>.

= Mediatek devices =

Some touchscreen drivers on Mediatek devices have issues because they don't follow the standards. You can compare the driver source of your driver (especially the functions <code>tpd_up</code> and <code>tpd_down</code>) with [https://github.com/z3ntu/android_kernel_fairphone_FP1/blob/postmarketOS/mediatek/custom/common/kernel/touchpanel/ft5316/ft5316_driver.c#L320-L350 the Fairphone 1 touchscreen driver] and see if adjusting your touchscreen driver to mostly match that behavior helps.
