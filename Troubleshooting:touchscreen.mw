= Generic debugging steps =

== Test with evtest ==

You can test if the touchscreen emits any events with <code>evtest</code>.

== Test with libinput debug-events ==

You can check if libinput understands the events your touchscreen driver emits with <code>libinput debug-events</code>.

For example it's possible that libinput doesn't get any events or that it doesn't get TOUCH_DOWN/TOUCH_UP events. You can see the raw events libinput receives with <code>libinput record</code>.

= Mediatek devices =

Some touchscreen drivers on Mediatek devices have issues because they don't follow the standards. You can compare the driver source of your driver (especially the functions <code>tpd_up</code> and <code>tpd_down</code>) with [https://github.com/z3ntu/android_kernel_fairphone_FP1/blob/postmarketOS/mediatek/custom/common/kernel/touchpanel/ft5316/ft5316_driver.c#L320-L350 the Fairphone 1 touchscreen driver] and see if adjusting your touchscreen driver to mostly match that behavior helps.

= sec_touchscreen: kernel bug =

<pre>
event3 - sec_touchscreen: kernel bug: device has min == max on ABS_MT_PRESSURE from libinput debug-events
</pre>

This message, which can be found in <code>libinput debug-events</code> indicates that the touchscreen driver in the kernel is misbehaving and that libinput won't accept the input.

In this case, solving the issue means patching the touchscreen driver, which will require you to modify your kernel code. While the device is running, figure out which driver is being used, perhaps by running <code>find /sys -name "input*"</code> or <code>find /sys -name "event*"</code>, use <code>grep</code> in your kernel source to find the line [https://github.com/djeman/android_kernel_samsung_sharkls/blob/e3381e42b00e1ff977815b365cea53f18afff7a8/drivers/input/touchscreen/ist30xxc/ist30xxc.c#L1449 line that contains <code>input_set_abs_params(input_dev, ABS_MT_PRESSURE, 0, 0);</code>], and comment it out. Rebuild the kernel and try again. See our [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Patching patching] guide for more information about how to make these changes correctly.
