Some Androids only accept [[Glossary#boot.img|boot.img]] files in the '''QCDT''' format, which means the [[Glossary#dtb|dtb]] is appended to the end of it (and not at the end of the kernel, as with most other Android devices).

== Does my device need a QCDT boot.img file? ==
Analyze a known working boot.img file with pmbootstrap to find out, if it has the QCDT format or not. You can get such a file from downloading a TWRP image (it is directly in the boot.img format!) or by downloading a full Android ROM for your device and extracting the boot.img file.
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap bootimg_analyze /path/to/boot.img
</syntaxhighlight>

If this prints <code>deviceinfo_bootimg_qcdt="true"</code>, then you have a QCDT device.

== Properly package a QCDT device ==
The easiest way is using <code>pmbootstrap init</code> to generate a new device, and let it analyze the boot.img file in the process. It will adjust the device and linux package as necessary. But if you want to do it manually:
* Set <code>deviceinfo_bootimg_qcdt="true"</code> in the [[deviceinfo]]
* Adjust your <code>linux-</code> APKBUILD to generate the <code>/boot/dt.img</code> (look at other QCDT devices to see how it's done, grep for qcdt in aports)

== Debugging ==
* Hook up the [[serial UART]] and see what kind of debug output the bootloader provides
* Repack the boot image with a working <code>dt.img</code> from another distribution (stock, Lineage, recovery, etc.)

=== Repack procedure ===
You need <code>mkbootimg</code> and <code>unpackbootimg</code> tools which are already packaged in pmbootstrap.

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ ./pmbootstrap build mkbootimg unpackbootimg
$ ./unpackbootimg -i $SOMEDIR/boot.img-$vendor-$name -o pmos
$ ./unpackbootimg -i $OTHERDIR/boot.img -o other
$ cp other/boot.img-dt pmos/boot.img-$vendor-$name-dt
$ ./mkbootimg -o boot.repack.img -r pmos/boot.img-$vendor-$name-
</syntaxhighlight>
