{{note|This is a technical page designed to see how to implement support for Samsung modems in postmarketOS.}}

Samsung modems use three abstraction layers:

# Kernel interface (specific to each modem)
# Samsung IPC modem protocol (specific to Samsung devices)
# Radio Interface Layer (universal)

The IPC protocol, <code>libsamsung-ipc</code>, has been [https://redmine.replicant.us/projects/replicant/wiki/Libsamsung-ipc reimplemented as free software by Replicant].

There [https://lists.ofono.org/pipermail/ofono/2012-September/013777.html have been patches to add libsamsung-ipc support] to ofono, a potential RIL for postmarketOS, but it doesn't seem like they were merged due to licensing issues which have now been resolved.  The patches have been forward-ported to the new libsamsung-ipc interfaces at https://github.com/xc-racer99/ofono
