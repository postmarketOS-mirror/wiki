{{note|This is a technical page designed to see how to implement support for Samsung modems in postmarketOS.}}

Samsung modems use three abstraction layers:

# Kernel interface (specific to each modem)
## This can be further divided into the power control of the modem, the kernel<->userspace interaction, and the kernel<->modem interaction
# Samsung IPC modem protocol (specific to Samsung devices)
# Radio Interface Layer
## On Android, this is via RIL, it could go via oFono on pmOS

The IPC protocol, <code>libsamsung-ipc</code>, has been [https://redmine.replicant.us/projects/replicant/wiki/Libsamsung-ipc reimplemented as free software by Replicant].

There [https://lists.ofono.org/pipermail/ofono/2012-September/013777.html have been patches to add libsamsung-ipc support] to ofono, a potential RIL for postmarketOS, but it doesn't seem like they were merged due to licensing issues which have now been resolved.  libsamsung-ipc has since been almost entirely re-written, but the patches have been forward-ported at https://github.com/xc-racer99/ofono and https://github.com/xc-racer99/libsamsung-ipc
