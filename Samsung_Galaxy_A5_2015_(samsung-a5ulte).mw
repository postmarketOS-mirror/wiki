{{Device owners}}

== Supported variants ==
* '''SM-A500F:''' Choose <code>samsung-a5lte</code>.
* '''SM-A500FU:''' Choose <code>samsung-a5ulte</code>.
* Adding support for one of the other variants is likely trivial.

== Installation ==
# Install [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd#readme lk2nd] (alternative bootloader that provides a standard fastboot interface)
# Follow the [[Installation guide]]
# If you don't install wifi firmware, display won't work

{{note|'''Note:''' Enter lk2nd fastboot mode by pressing only Volume Down + Power ('''not''' the Home button). Pressing the Home button additionally will bring you to the Samsung Download mode.}}

== Audio ==
See [[Qualcomm_Snapdragon_410_(MSM8916)#Audio]]. Note that the speaker is currently not working (Samsung messed up here and used a custom speaker amplifier that is totally overcomplicated...) The Earpiece works fine.

== Modem ==
See [[Qualcomm_Snapdragon_410_(MSM8916)#Modem]].

== Screen ==

Screen works partially. While displaying the UI works fine, adjusting the brightness doesn't work.

== Plasma Mobile ==
Plasma mobile currently works on A5 2015, but you should set custom scaling factor to 2.

<code>kscreen-doctor output.1.scale.2</code> should work

Plasma works smoothly, but there are some graphical glitches like choppy text

== Hildon ==
Kinda works, it has to be rotated 90 degrees, and crashes when touched
