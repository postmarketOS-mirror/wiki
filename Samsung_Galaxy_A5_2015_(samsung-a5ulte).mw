== Installation ==
# Install [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd#readme lk2nd] (alternative bootloader that provides a standard fastboot interface)
# Follow the [[Installation guide]]
# If you don't install wifi firmware, display won't work

{{note|'''Note:''' Enter lk2nd fastboot mode by pressing only Volume Down + Power ('''not''' the Home button). Pressing the Home button additionally will bring you to the Samsung Download mode.}}

== Audio ==
<!-- TODO: Share this between all MSM8916 devices -->
Everything is muted by default and must be enabled through alsaucm. Unfortunately, the tool is not very user-friendly.

 $ alsaucm -i -c msm8916-samsung-a2015
 set _verb HiFi
 set _enadev <device>

where <code><device></code> is one of <code>Earpiece</code>, <code>Headphones</code>, <code>PrimaryMic</code>, <code>HeadsetMic</code> or <code>SecondaryMic</code>. (Speaker not supported yet...)
alsaucm does not track which devices are already enabled, therefore it is possible to produce combinations that won't work properly (e.g. <code>Headphones</code>+<code>Earpiece</code>). To switch between devices, the old device first needs to be re-enabled and then disabled:

 $ alsaucm -i -c msm8916-samsung-a2015
 set _verb HiFi
 set _enadev OLD
 set _disdev OLD
 set _enadev NEW

{{note|'''Warning:''' alsaucm sets the volume to maximum by default. It is possible to increase the volume even further, however, this may lead to permanent damage to your speaker!}}

== Plasma Mobile ==
Plasma mobile currently works on A5 2015, but you have to set custom scaling factor to 2.

<code>kscreen-doctor output.1.scale.2</code> should work

Plasma works smoothly, but there are some graphical glitches like choppy text

== Phosh ==
Does not work

== Hildon ==
Kinda works, it has to be rotated 90 degrees, and crashes when touched
