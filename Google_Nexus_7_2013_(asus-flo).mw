* Linaro, Qualcomm, Red Hat drivers, kernel upstreaming

=== Key combinations ===

* Boot to bootloader: Power + Volume Down
* Boot to recovery: Power + Volume Up
* Shutdown: Power

=== What works ===

* 3D Freedreno hardware acceleration
* Flashing with pmbootstrap/fastboot
* Upstream stable Kernel 4.11.12 + patches
* Screen
* Touchscreen input
* USB Internet
* WIFI Internet
* X11 Hildon, Mate, Xfce, Xwayland-Weston, Plasma-mobile, matchbox
* TWRP Recovery
* PREEMPT_RT (not on by default)

=== What does not work yet ===

* Audio
* Hardware Video decoding
* Bluetooth
* Sensors
* Camera

=== Issues ===

* WIFI firmware sometimes does not load on boot. WIFI connection is very slow. You need to start [[WiFi#Start_WIFI_manually]] as the firmware loads late in the boot process.
<pre>sudo wpa_supplicant -u -Dnl80211 -B -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -iwlan0
sudo nmcli device wifi connect "ssd" password "pass" ifname wlan0</pre>
=== Other information ===

* Flash the system to a userdata partition to have 10GB free space. If you don't see 10GB install TWRP recovery and format system/all partitions and start again:
<pre>./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_rootfs --partition userdata
./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_kernel</pre>
* I would recommend installing and using [[MATE]] as it is very complete
* To run Internet via USB see [[USB Internet]]
