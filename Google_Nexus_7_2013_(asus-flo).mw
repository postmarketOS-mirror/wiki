=== Key combinations ===

* Boot to bootloader: Power + Volume Down
* Boot to recovery: Power + Volume Up
* Shutdown: Power

=== Issues ===

* WIFI firmware sometimes does not load on boot. WIFI connection is very slow - probably to the wcn36xx driver still being a work in progress. You need to start [[WiFi#Start_WIFI_manually]] as the firmware loads late in the boot process.
<pre>sudo wpa_supplicant -u -Dnl80211 -B -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -iwlan0
sudo nmcli device wifi connect "ssd" password "pass" ifname wlan0</pre>
=== Other information ===

* Flash the system to a userdata partition to have 10GB free space. If you don't see 10GB install TWRP recovery and format system/all partitions and start again:
<pre>./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_rootfs --partition userdata
./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_kernel</pre>

* When I tried flashing rootfs, it would fail almost immediately after erasing.  I installed TWRP, and tried a few things to "wipe" it, which worked, and then permitted the good flash (with hildon UI) below.  (Note that, although the instructions for TWRP 3.2.2-0 for asus-flo suggest that you might need to do "fastboot reboot" and then hold down the buttons, that only resulted in what appeared to be boot loops of TWRP -- what worked instead was to use the buttons to power off, and then use the buttons to boot recovery.)

* When I tried flashing with the Hildon UI (on 2018-07-27), it booted to the blue Hildon wallpaper, but the wallpaper only filled a square subset of the display.

* For unknown reasons, I'm seeing rootfs flash times that seem slow.  For example, a flash of plasma-mobile ui (808 MB) took 850.323s, with 808.169s of that in sending phase.  This is approx. 10 times the duration for flashing sony-amami from the same laptop.

* I would recommend installing and using [[MATE]] as it is very complete
* To run Internet via USB see [[USB Internet]]

* Correct battery charge info appears to be in: /sys/bus/i2c/drivers/bq27xxx-battery/0-0055/power_supply/bq27541-0/charge_now

* It's possible that Nexus 7 2013 units have flash hardware problems: [https://www.androidpolice.com/2015/04/19/reports-suggest-2013-nexus-7-units-are-failing-at-an-alarming-rate-not-likely-a-result-of-firmware-updates/ AndroidPolice.com 2015-04-19], [https://appleinsider.com/articles/13/06/18/googles-nexus-7-tablets-dying-early-possibly-due-to-cheap-memory appleinsider.com 2013-06-18]
