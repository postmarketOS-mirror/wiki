== Contributors ==

* jonty-comp
* Jasper (working on [[ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity]])

== What works ==

* Compiling CM13 kernel ([https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_asus_tf300t GitHub])
* Flashing via Android recovery zip (Boot image included)
* System boots
* Most sensors/cameras/devices seem to be detected (e.g. accelerometer values can be read from <code>/sys</code> etc)

== What does not work ===

* Flashing via fastboot (device appears to write successfully but then locks up and does not apply the uploaded image)
* Framebuffer (stuck on ASUS bootloader graphic)

The framebuffer issue is an interesting one as it works without issue on CM13-based Android ROMs with the same kernel and defconfig.  Possible toolchain issue or patch needed for GCC6.
Devices with a working framebuffer output modesetting information in <code>dmesg</code> after loading the tegradc driver, but the PMOS compiled kernel does not.  Common fixes including setting values in <code>/sys</code> have no effect yet.
