== Serial console ==
The PineTab has a serial port in the headphone connector, it's activated by a switch behind the SD card cover. If the switch is pointed toward the SD card the headphone connector is in audio mode, if it's pointed the other way it's in UART mode.

The uart is 115200n8

The pinout for the serial connector on the tablet side is:

* Tip: RX
* Ring: TX
* Sleeve: GND

The serial connection is 3.3V

You can also buy the debug cable from [https://store.pine64.org PINE64 Store]

=== Touchscreen ===

The touchscreen on the PineTab is controlled by <code>goodix</code> module on i2c-0, at address 0x5d.

=== Cameras ===
Both front and back camera shares the same csi-0 bus. Currently only the back camera (OV5640) has mainline support.

It's not clear what would it reacts to both front and back camera. More information needed on this.

Since Cerdus is at <code>/dev/video0</code>, the CSI is at <code>/dev/video1</code> and can be controlled with <code>/dev/media1</code> using <code>media-ctl</code>

<source lang="shell-session">
pine-pinetab:~# media-ctl --set-v4l2 '"ov5640 2-003c":0[fmt:UYVY8_2X8/1280x720]' -d /dev/media1
pine-pinetab:~# ffmpeg -s 1280x720 -f video4linux2 -i /dev/video1 -vframes 1 selfie.jpg
</source>

=== Wi-Fi ===
Wi-Fi works using the [https://github.com/Icenowy/rtl8723cs RTL8723CS driver from Icenowy], loads and connect to a Wi-Fi perfectly fine. However power saving capabilities aren't working, so the PineTab battery will drain more quicker.

=== Bluetooth ===
Bluetooth also works on this device after installing <code>firmware-rtl8723bt</code>, there is a patch series on LKML.

=== Accelerometer ===

The accelerometer driver is for BMA250 on mainline, and works just fine. The accelerometer value could be get here:

<source lang="shell-session">
pine-pinetab:~$ cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device1/name 
BMA222E
pine-pinetab:~$ cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device1/in_accel_x_raw 
-1
pine-pinetab:~$ cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device1/in_accel_y_raw 
28
pine-pinetab:~$ cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device1/in_accel_z_raw 
-12
</source>

=== Audio ===
==== Speakers ====
Sound output should work after unmuting <code>AIF1 Slot 0 digital</code> and <code>DAC</code>. However Danct12's unit had it's speakers broken so this hasn't tested on him, but confirmed working on others.

The Speaker output is named "Line Out"

==== Headphone Jack ====
Thankfully our device still has the headphone jack, so you could still listen to "The Beatles", right?

Well, sure. Headphones should work after unmuting <code>Headphone</code> and <code>AIF1 Slot 0 digital</code>.

==== Microphone ====
Microphone can be enabled by toggle capture and unmute "AIF1 Data Digital Audio", "Mic1", "Mic2".

The microphone can be found here:
