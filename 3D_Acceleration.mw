Using proprietary Android drivers is possible with [[Hybris]].

== Adreno ==

== Vivante ==

== Mali ==

There are two projects for open source Mali drivers.

The lima driver is for the Mali Utgard GPUs, specifically the Mali 400 (2008) and the Mali 450 (2012)

The panfrost drivers is for the Mali Midgard (T6*, T7*, T8*) and Bifrost GPUs (G*)

== PowerVR ==

== Tegra ==

The opensource reverse-engineered driver for Tegra GPUs is Grate (anagram of "tegra"). It seems to work with Tegra 2, 3 and 4 GPUs

The newer Tegra K1 and X1 use an 3D core that can be used with Nouveau instead with a seperate tegra display driver to handle the I/O

== VideoCore ==

There are two projects for open source VideoCore drivers.

The vc4 driver is for Broadcom VideoCore IV GPUs.

The v3d driver is for Broadcom VideoCore V and VideoCore VI GPUs.
