== About ==
This page documents the status of mainline Linux on the OnePlus 6!

The phone is currently capable of booting modern Linux with only a few patches, [https://gitlab.com/sdm845-mainline/sdm845-linux see the kernel here] and check the table on the right for the hardware support checklist.

== Notes ==

* The battery driver is pretty broken right now and will always show the battery as fully charged, be careful not to leave your phone unplugged running postmarketOS as the battery will drain until it's dead, requiring you to charge it while off for a short period before powering on your phone again (and potentially damaging the battery).

== Installing ==

<code>pmbootstrap init</code>, pick enchilada / fajita device depending on your taste :D

Most UIs work well, phosh is quite good, plasma mobile does seems to be more buggy.
For phosh set <code>scale=3</code> in <code>/usr/share/phosh/phoc.ini</code> under DSI-1 to fix scaling.

Now run the following to build and flash:
<pre>
pmbootstrap install --split
pmbootstrap export
</pre>
Reboot back into bootloader mode after each of the following commands, replacing enchilada with fajita where appropriate.
<pre>
fastboot erase dtbo
fastboot flash vendor /tmp/postmarketOS-export/oneplus-enchilada-boot.img
fastboot flash system /tmp/postmarketOS-export/oneplus-enchilada-root.img
fastboot flash boot /tmp/postmarketOS-export/boot.img-oneplus-sdm845
</pre>

Reboot and you should see dmesg on your screen :D

If you have flashing or booting issues, try first flashing the latest OxygenOS to the slot you want to install postmarketOS to (ie, flash in TWRP from your other slot). If you still have no luck, try flashing OOS 9 as the bootloader can be more forgiving.

It is possible to dual boot with android by following the guide above and using

<code>fastboot --set-active=[a|b]</code>

to switch to your inactive slot before flashing.

{{note|The fastboot implementation on OnePlus 6 is dodgy at the best of times, especially on the OOS 10 bootloader. If you have issues running fastboot commands then choose 'REBOOT BOOTLOADER' from the menu on device and run the fastboot command while it reboots, wait for it to finish. It also helps to reboot back into fastboot after every command.}}


=== Issues ===

==== Installing ====
A small number of users have reported their device being stuck on the bootloader unlocked screen after installing, follow the debugging steps below if that happens to you

The first and simplest debugging step is to see if the kernel is booting, this can be done by checking for a gadget mode device appearing in dmesg on your host, you can do this by putting the phone in fastboot mode and then running <code>dmesg -w</code> in a terminal, opening another and running:
<pre>
fastboot boot /tmp/postmarketOS-export/boot.img-oneplus-sdm845
</pre>
The terminal running <code>dmesg -w</code> should see output similar to the following:
<pre>
[79239.786757] usb 1-3: new high-speed USB device number 10 using xhci_hcd
[79240.031271] usb 1-3: New USB device found, idVendor=18d1, idProduct=d00d, bcdDevice= 1.00

</pre>
Note the first device up until <code>USB disconnect</code> is the phone appearing in fastboot mode, followed by it booting into the kernel.

If you don't see a <code>USB disconnect</code> line, make sure you have run <code>fastboot erase dtbo</code>. If you do but it is not followed by a new device appearing, try flashing a different version of OxygenOS to the slot you're on (ie by switching slots and then flashing the OTA from TWRP), OOS 9 can behave better. If you still have issues and have tried reflashing multiple times, feel free to contact <code>@kalube</code> in the [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Matrix_and_IRC #mainline:postmarketos] matrix channel.

==== Bluetooth ====
Bluetooth does not show up in Phosh UI, but works fine with bluetoothctl, not sure why this is.

==== Sleep ====
The power button **does** work, but it doesn't turn of the touch screen, as a result your inputs will still be registered with the screen off.

== How to enter flash mode ==

Unplug from USB, hold {{Button|Power}} and {{Button|Volume Up}} until you see "Fastboot Mode" text.

= Status =

== Bluetooth ==
Does work, tested with a bluetooth headset.
Requires some messing about with bluetoothctl, doesn't appear in Phosh UI at all, although how much of this is device issues rather than Phosh issues I'm not sure.

<pre>
sudo service bluetooth start
</pre>
Then
<pre>
bluetoothctl
[bluetooth]# power off
[bluetooth]# power on
[bluetooth]# default-agent
[bluetooth]# scan on
[bluetooth]# discoverable on
[bluetooth]# devices
[bluetooth]# pair <device>
-- WAIT --
[bluetooth]# connect <device>
</pre>
