Unplug from USB, hold {{Button|Power}} and {{Button|Volume Up}} until your see "Fastboot Mode" text.

Mainline kernel is up and running, with more and more hardware being added!

[https://github.com/calebccff/linux/commits/enchilada-usb Linux 5.7 - enchilada]

* Boots without random panics
* SimpleFB display works to get output on the screen
* Touch works! [https://github.com/calebccff/linux/commits/enchilada-touchscreen after a massive false start]
* USB host mode works - with a powered hub only
* Power button works
* tri-state-keys work

USB peripheral mode is the next step, then hopefully wifi/bt/audio.
