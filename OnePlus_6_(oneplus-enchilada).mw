== Mainline Kernel ==

Mainline kernel is up and running, with more and more hardware being added!

* Boots without random panics
* DSI display works but is somewhat broken - [mailto:caleb@connolly.tech please email me if you can help!]
* Touch works! [https://github.com/calebccff/linux/commits/enchilada-touchscreen after a massive false start]
* USB networking and host mode both work, however it isn't possible to switch without recompiling the DTS.
* Buttons (power/vol/tri-state) all function
