== About ==
This page describes the support for postmarketOS on the OnePlus 6/T.
The phone is running a mainline kernel which you can find [https://gitlab.com/sdm845-mainline/sdm845-linux here].

== Notes ==

* Wifi is functional! Although there is a [https://gitlab.com/sdm845-mainline/sdm845-linux/-/commit/7f485ed31b6e66e32cc3bdc385fc95532fc531a6 normally fatal error that must be ignored] in order for the drivers to successfully probe.

== Installing == 

<code>pmbootstrap init</code>, pick enchilada / fajita device depending on your taste :D

Most UIs work well, phosh is quite good, plasma mobile does seems to be more buggy.
For phosh set <code>scale=3</code> in <code>/usr/share/phosh/phoc.ini</code> under DSI-1 to fix scaling.

Now run the following to build and flash:
<pre>
pmbootstrap install --split
pmbootstrap export
</pre>
Reboot back into bootloader mode after each of the following commands, replacing enchilada with fajita where appropriate.
<pre>
fastboot erase dtbo
fastboot flash vendor /tmp/postmarketOS-export/oneplus-enchilada-boot.img
fastboot flash system /tmp/postmarketOS-export/oneplus-enchilada-root.img
fastboot flash boot /tmp/postmarketOS-export/boot.img-oneplus-sdm845
</pre>

Reboot and you should see dmesg on your screen :D

If you have flashing or booting issues, try first flashing the latest OxygenOS to the slot you want to install postmarketOS to (ie, flash in TWRP from your other slot). If you still have no luck, try flashing OOS 9 as the bootloader can be more forgiving.

It is possible to dual boot with android by following the guide above and using

<code>fastboot --set-active=[a|b]</code>

to switch to your inactive slot before flashing.

{{note|The fastboot implementation on OnePlus 6 is dodgy at the best of times, especially on the OOS 10 bootloader. If you have issues running fastboot commands then choose 'REBOOT BOOTLOADER' from the menu on device and run the fastboot command while it reboots, wait for it to finish. It also helps to reboot back into fastboot after every command.}}

== How to enter flash mode ==

Unplug from USB, hold {{Button|Power}} and {{Button|Volume Up}} until you see "Fastboot Mode" text.

== Bluetooth ==
Does work, tested with a bluetooth headset.
Requires some messing about with bluetoothctl, doesn't appear in Phosh UI at all, although how much of this is device issues rather than Phosh issues I'm not sure.

<pre>
sudo service bluetooth start
</pre>
Then
<pre>
bluetoothctl
[bluetooth]# power off
[bluetooth]# power on
[bluetooth]# default-agent
[bluetooth]# scan on
[bluetooth]# discoverable on
[bluetooth]# devices
[bluetooth]# pair <device>
-- WAIT --
[bluetooth]# connect <device>
</pre>
