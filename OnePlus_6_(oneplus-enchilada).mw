== Mainline Kernel ==

Mainline kernel is up and running, with more and more hardware being added constantly.

* Touch works! [https://github.com/calebccff/linux/commits/enchilada-touchscreen after a massive false start]
* USB networking works (dual role / host mode needs some work).
* Buttons (power/vol/tri-state) all function
* Modem boots up but ofonoctl doesn't detect any sim slots.
* Wifi is semi-functional! There is a [https://gitlab.com/sdm845-mainline/sdm845-linux-next/-/commit/7f485ed31b6e66e32cc3bdc385fc95532fc531a6 normally fatal error that must be ignored] in order to boot wlan, but it does
successfully connect to networks with dhcp.
