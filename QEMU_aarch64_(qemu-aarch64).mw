=== Usage ===
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap init  # Choose device "qemu-aarch64"
$ pmbootstrap install --no-fde
$ pmbootstrap qemu --image-size=2G --display=gtk --arch=aarch64
</syntaxhighlight>

Using the <code>--display=gtk</code> parameter is recommended. In the GTK interface, click on ''View / Show Tabs'' to display all available outputs as tabs next to each other. Check the <code>serial0</code> output for what it is actually doing as the boot will probably take a few minutes, unless you have a very fast PC.

Enable 3D acceleration (virglrenderer) with the <code>gl=on</code> display option. <br>Example: <code>--display=gtk,gl=on</code> or <code>--display=sdl,gl=on</code>

== What works ==
* Serial output
* SSH
* Graphical output via dri (as configured in device-qemu-aarch64 for weston)
* Keyboard and mouse

== What does not work ==
* Writing to framebuffer seems to be broken (splash screen doesn't work)
