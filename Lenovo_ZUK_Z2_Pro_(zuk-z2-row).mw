== How to enter flash mode ==

* Apply for bootloader unlocking file at ZUI official website (Chinese): https://www.zui.com/iunlock
* Following official guides to unlock the bootloader
* After unlocking, you get a menu to select boot mode every time the phone powers on. Choose bootloader to enter fastboot mode.

== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. WiFi, photos, ... -->

== Notes ==

=== Partitions ===

The <code>persist</code> partition stores device-specific information like WLAN & Bluetooth MAC. You'd better leave it as is. I don't know how to recover it.

=== LED / Torch / Screen brightness / vibrator  ===

Write brightness or boolean value to specific sysfs files:

* Front panel LED light: <code>/sys/class/leds/{red,green,blue}/{brightness,blink}</code>
* Torch light: <code>/sys/class/leds/led:torch_{0,1}/brightness</code> (torch_0 is cold light, torch_1 is warm light)
* Screen brightness: <code>/sys/class/leds/lcd-backlight/brightness</code>
* Vibrator: <code>echo $TIME_MS > /sys/class/timed_output/vibrator/enable</code>

For brightness range, check the <code>max_brightness</code> file.

=== WiFi ===

Loading <code>wlan</code> driver on boot (default setting) will significantly increase booting time (half a min -> 3 minutes to GUI). I don't know why.
