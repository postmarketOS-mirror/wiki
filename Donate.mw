== Notes ==

* postmarketOS is only usable for developers right now
* Donations go to individuals, not the project as a whole
* Not all contributors accept donations
* Before we let money destroy the community, we will cancel donations altogether

== Developer-specific donations ==
''Feel free to add yourself to the list if you have contributed something and intend to do so in the future. If you don't like how donations are handled, please [https://github.com/postmarketOS/postmarketos.org/issues/28 get involved in the discussion]. Please order the names alphabetically. Do not add bitcoin addresses here directly, as these can be swapped out easily without being noticed - it's better to link to a page that only you can edit instead (e.g. GitHub account, blog, ...).''

=== Clayton Craft (craftyguy) ===
If you're crazy enough to want to throw money at me, I ask that you instead throw your money at one (or all) of the following organizations, or to any other organization committed to making the world a better place:
* [https://my.fsf.org/donate Free Software Foundation (FSF)]
* [https://supporters.eff.org/donate Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)]
* [http://www.msf.org/en/donate Doctors Without Borders / Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)]

What I do:
* A maintainer for the N900 on pmOS, including helping to keep N900 support relevant in upstream components (e.g. [https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/ofono/ofono.git/commit/?id=cbac15cdd9858e797f223bf9d16116f82e184d88 ofono])
* [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pulls/craftyguy Numerous PRs for pmOS], focusing primarily on usability.
* [https://github.com/postmarketOS/osk-sdl OSK-SDL], a touchscreen keyboard for running in initramfs, used for unlocking LUKS rootfs on boot for touch-only devices

=== Oliver Smith (ollieparanoid) ===
I am not accepting donations currently. If you would like to donate something, take a look at the organizations that craftyguy listed above: FSF, EFF, MSF. You can also show your support by adding a star to the postmarketOS gitlab projects, subscribing and posting to our subreddit and by telling your favorite journalists (bloggers, podcasters, ...) about postmarketOS.

What I do:
* Worked on <code>pmboostrap</code> and postmarketOS about one year before [https://ollieparanoid.github.io/post/postmarketOS/ releasing] it
* Building a helpful community of developers, which make decisions together
* Making development enjoyable for everyone and making postmarketOS a daily driver (see my [[Milestones#ollieparanoid|milestones]] for details)

=== Martijn Braam (martijnbraam) ===
I have a [http://patreon.com/martijnbraam Patreon page]

What I do:
* Developing tools to make other postmarketOS development easier
* Reviewing and merging merge requests for pmaports
* Hosting the postmarketOS infra
* Mess with lots of random parts of random devices.
