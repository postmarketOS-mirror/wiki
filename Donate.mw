== Notes ==

* postmarketOS is only usable for developers right now
* Donations go to individuals, not the project as a whole
* Not all contributors accept donations
* Before we let money destroy the community, we will cancel donations altogether

== Developers ==
''Feel free to add yourself to the list if you have contributed something and intend to do so in the future. If you don't like how donations are handled, please [https://github.com/postmarketOS/postmarketos.org/issues/28 get involved in the discussion]. Please order the names alphabetically. Do not add bitcoin addresses here directly, as these can be swapped out easily without being noticed - it's better to link to a page that only you can edit instead (e.g. GitHub account, blog, ...).''

Donate via:
* [https://liberapay.com/ollieparanoid Liberapay] ([https://ollieparanoid.github.io/page/donate/ why?])

What I do:
* Worked on <code>pmboostrap</code> and postmarketOS about 1 year before [https://ollieparanoid.github.io/post/postmarketOS/ releasing] it
* Keeping development enjoyable for everyone by fixing <code>pmbootstrap</code> bugs (usually within few days, we're always pretty close to 0), giving a lot of thought to the [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/ issues]
* Testing/reviewing/merging contributions from others
* Implementing new <code>pmbootstrap</code> features, especially ones that others require to be unblocked from their development, and ones that lower the entry barrier to the project (though that happens less often now, as I spend more time on testing/reviewing/merging PRs from other people, which means faster development!)
* Trying to recruit new developers with blogging ([https://github.com/postmarketOS/postmarketos.org not alone anymore]!) and answering questions everywhere
* Directly helping out in the chat when I find time to do so
* Check out my [[Milestones#ollieparanoid|milestones]]

What I do:
