== Notes ==

* postmarketOS is only usable for developers right now
* Donations go to individuals, not the project as a whole
* Not all contributors accept donations
* This project isn't about money: before this destroys the community, we cancel donations altogether

== Developers ==
''Feel free to add yourself to the list if you have contributed something and intend to do so in the future. If you don't like how donations are handled, please [https://github.com/postmarketOS/postmarketos.org/issues/28 get involved in the discussion].''
