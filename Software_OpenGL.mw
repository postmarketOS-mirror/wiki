Some interfaces, like [[Hildon]] or simple games require 3D acceleration, even though they are only rendering fancy 2D graphics. With postmarketOS, we have a lot of devices, where 3d acceleration does not work, or does not work with open source drivers. As a workaround, it is possible to do that kind of rendering in software with mesa-swrast. But that is too slow to be usable in most cases. This article lists some alternatives, that will hopefully be more performant.

== TinyGLES ==
[https://github.com/lunixbochs/tinygles TinyGLES] was originally written and optimized for the Pandora, which uses the same chipset as the N900. Upstream told us, that it is worth trying at least.

We've tried a bit to get Hildon working, but we did not get very far with it yet.

<pre>
Current stack:
(hardware) - mesa (swrast) - cogl - clutter - hildon

New stack:
(hardware) - tinygles - glshim - cogl - clutter - hildon
</pre>

It makes sense to run cogl demos with tinygles before trying anything hildon or clutter related, as Clutter depends on cogl.
