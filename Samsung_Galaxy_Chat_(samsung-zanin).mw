== How to enter flash mode ==
From off state, press and hold {{Button|Volume Down}} + {{Button|Power}}, then release {{Button|Power}} and hold the other.

A confirmation dialog will appear, you need to press {{Button|Volume Up}} to confirm. 

== SD card Installation ==
Note that flashing the pmOS kernel will increase the counter shown in ODIN mode (CUSTOM BIN DOWN)

I don't know if there is a way to clear this counter, but I don't think is important.

* Build the image on your computer and prepare the SD card
 $ pmbootstrap init
 $ pmbootstrap install --sdcard=/dev/mmcblk0
* Put the phone in ODIN mode and connect it to your computer
 $ pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel

<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->
== Issues ==
* The touchscreen works in `ts_test` but does not work in Weston or i3wm
* The Sym key does not work and gives no output in `xev`

On Android the {{Button|Alt}} key can be used to type symbols.

On pmOS this does not work (it only works as the Alt key), 
so currently there is currently no way of typing symbols.

Probably a custom keymap is needed
