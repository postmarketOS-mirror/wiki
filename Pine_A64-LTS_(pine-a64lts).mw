== Serial console ==

The Pine board has a 3.3v UART on the EXP 10-pin header.

* Pin 6 is GND
* Pin 7 is TX
* Pin 8 is RX

== Headphone jack ==

Install alsa-utils with apk, launch alsamixer, unmute (press M) "Headphone", "AIF1 Slot 0 Digi" and "DAC" (or "DAC Reversed"), increase the volume of "Headphone" to something over zero.

Then you can play some music (e.g. a .wav file) with aplay.
