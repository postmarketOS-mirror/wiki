There are pre-existing ports of Alpine Linux for i386 and AMD64 generic PC hardware and virtual machines.[https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/]

It should be possible to [[Existing Alpine installation|convert a pre-existing Alpine install to a pmOS install]].

This could be used for x86 Windows tablets with a BIOS.
