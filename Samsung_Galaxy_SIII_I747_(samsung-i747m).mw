== Bluetooth ==

Not generally packaged yet - I still need a way to integrate it with bluez5 utilities, which seem to need the driver to be in kernelspace. Still, it works with the legacy utils to scan, pair, and be usable.

Steps:

* Download [https://github.com/imilka/proprietary_vendor_samsung/blob/master/n7100/proprietary/system/bin/bcm4334.hcd the proprietary firmware blob] for the Bluetooth chip on to your device.
* Download and build (in armhf build chroot) [https://github.com/AsteroidOS/brcm-patchram-plus/tree/master/src broadcom-patchram-plus], and move to your device. (install autoconf, automake, libtool, run '''./autogen.sh''', run '''make''')
* Run '''./brcm_patchram_plus --patchram bcm4334.hcd --enable_hci --no2bytes --tosleep 50000 --use_baudrate_for_download --baudrate 4000000 /dev/
