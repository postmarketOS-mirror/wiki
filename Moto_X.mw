== Entering &quot;Fastboot mode&quot; ==
Hold <code>Volume Down</code> + <code>Power</code>, let go of <code>Power</code> once the device display does something (e.g. turns from battery icon to black screen).

== Installation ==
<pre>
pmbootstrap install
pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel
pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs
</pre>

The device must be in bootloader mode. While flashing, it's normal to see "variable not supported!" messages.
