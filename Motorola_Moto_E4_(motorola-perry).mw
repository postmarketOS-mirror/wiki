== How to enter flash mode ==
hold Power On and Volume Down buttons while device is powered off.

The device has to be unlocked before images can be replaced. It is strongly suggested to use TWRP recovery (twrp-perry-3.2.1-r1.img verified to work) if debugging is necessary. 
If the device does not boot it is possible to access log from last attempt at sys/fs/pstore/console-ramoops via TWRP.

== Installation ==
This port has been done on the SKU: XT1766 of the Motorola E4 (Perry) version<br>
This port has been tested on the SKU: XT1765 of the Motorola E4 (Perry)<br>
<code>$ pmbootstrap install</code><br>
plug the device to computer and switch it to the fastboot mode <br>
<code>$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</code><br>
<code>$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs</code><br>
finally run <code>$ pmbootstrap flasher boot</code> or reset the device<br>

Device should boot with display and be accessible via ssh @172.16.42.1 

== Additional information ==
Normally display should work without any modification but at the time of writing there was a compatibility issue with Xorg packages (particularly Xorg-server) in the EDGE repository.
To resolve the issue after flashing the phone postmarketos-ui-xfce4 and Xorg-server packages have been removed and installed from 3.11/main repository.
