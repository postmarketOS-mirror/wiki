== Development ==
This diagram ilustrates how is Tegra developed.

== Graphics ==
[[File:Tegra_mesa.svg|right|450px]]
=== Components [https://github.com/grate-driver/ (source)] ===
* libdrm
* Mesa-3D (minimal implementation, not complete enough (GL 1.4) to run XWayland (requires GL 2.1 or GLES2)
* xf86-video-tegra (2D acceleration for X11, EXA)
* libvdpau-tegra

=== Usability ===
Wayland:
* Phosh works, but UI is accelerated trough llvmpipe (software rendering), thus is slow.
* Plasma mobile not tested (please update)

X11:
* Xfce4 and Mate desktop will run on 2D acceleration.
* Hildon requires an OpenGL backend.
** As of cogl 1.22.2 the clutter/cogl backend requires stencil buffers (<code>EGL_STENCIL_SIZE</code>). This not yet implemented in the grate-driver.

=== Video Decoding ===

Video Decoder Engine (VDE) was added to mainline kernel v4.16. The grate-driver includes hardware h264 decoding with libvdpau-tegra.

The vdpau driver does '''not''' support h264 videos encoded with:
* weighted prediction
* CABAC

Sample video that can be decoded with hardware acceleration:

<source lang="shell">
$ mpv --hwdec=vdpau trailer_720p.mov
Using hardware decoding (vdpau).
VO: [vdpau] 1280x720 vdpau[yuv420p]

== Participate development ==
=== Develop ===
==== Mesa3D Gallium driver ====
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/merge_requests/3456

* Host1x ABI rework (required before mesa implemenetation): [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hj7-Bup1NtjJVHzGvs92kTkah0EEh_9wDHBsQWUkuwo/edit (G. docs)] 
* migrate from TGSI to NIR
* establishing demos that work, where can be seen regression

=== Test & Review ===
==== sound: tegra_wm8994 ====
Sound codec used to glue WM8994 and Tegra boards. Used in Samsung P4, P4WiFi, i927.

Source (two latest commits):
* https://github.com/okias/linux/commits/tegra_wm8994
Previous source:
* https://github.com/okias/linux/commits/tegra_wm8994-i927
* https://github.com/okias/linux/commits/tegra_wm8994-p4wifi
two implementations, needs to be tested.

Present on: [http://deviceinfohw.ru/devices/index.php?platform=platform0&cpu=cpu0&brand=brand0&filter=tegrawm8994&submit=Search device list]
* if your device has this codec, use these patches + check DTS has entry for wm8994
* install alsa-utils and check sound (also you can use https://github.com/ford-prefect/xml2ucm/tree/master/src )
* if works as expected provide "Tested-by" or "Reviewed-by" tags to author

==== vibrator: isa1200 ====
Vibrator used in multiple devices and Tegra boards. Used in Samsung P4, P4WiFi, i927.

Source (last commit):
* https://github.com/okias/linux/commits/isa1200

Present on: [http://deviceinfohw.ru/devices/index.php?platform=platform0&cpu=cpu0&brand=brand0&filter=isa1200&submit=Search device list]
* if your device has this vibrator, use these patches + chagnge or add DTS has entry for isa1200 pointing to this vibrator
* test vibrator if works
* if works as expected provide "Tested-by" or "Reviewed-by" tags to author
