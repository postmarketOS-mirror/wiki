== Graphics ==
=== Components [https://github.com/grate-driver/ (source)] ===
* libdrm
* Mesa-3D (minimal implementation, not complete enough (GL 1.4) to run XWayland (requires GL 2.1 or GLES2)
* xf86-video-tegra (2D acceleration for X11, EXA)
* libvdpau-tegra

=== Usability ===
Wayland:
* Phosh works, but UI is accelerated trough llvmpipe (software rendering), thus is slow.
* Plasma mobile not tested (please update)

X11:
* Xfce4 and Mate desktop will run on 2D acceleration.
* Hildon requires an OpenGL backend.
** As of cogl 1.22.2 the clutter/cogl backend requires stencil buffers (<code>EGL_STENCIL_SIZE</code>). This not yet implemented in the grate-driver.

=== Video Decoding ===

Video Decoder Engine (VDE) was added to mainline kernel v4.16. The grate-driver includes hardware h264 decoding with libvdpau-tegra.

The vdpau driver does '''not''' support h264 videos encoded with:
* weighted prediction
* CABAC

Sample video that can be decoded with hardware acceleration:

$ mpv --hwdec=vdpau trailer_720p.mov

VO: [vdpau] 1280x720 vdpau[yuv420p]
