<!-- This person needs to be willing to answer questions from users of this device -->

== What works ==
* Compiling the kernel and booting ([https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/merge_requests/314 !314])
* Wifi with the proprietary firmware ([https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/merge_requests/309 !309])
* Display

== What does not work ==
* Probably everything else

== Notes ==
* The device and kernel packages are bascially just a copy of the [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S7_Edge_(samsung-hero2lte) Galaxy S7 Edge's] packages. The only difference is that the two devices use different panels.
