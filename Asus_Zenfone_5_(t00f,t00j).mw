== What works ==
* Installing manually to SD card
* Kernel compilation (LineageOS unofficial)
* Initramfs boot
* USB Network
* Framebuffer graphics (Splash screens)
* SSH Connectivity
* Touchscreen

== What does not work ==
* Flashing using <code>pmbootstrap flasher</code>
* Sensors
* GPS
* Wayland
* Wifi
* Audio playback
* Probably everything else

== How to enter flash mode ==
Hold power button and volume up while device is turned off

== Installation ==
Zenfone 5 uses non-standard bootimg format, so we'll need to create it manually.
You'll need a working Zenfone 5 boot.img to proceed.

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap install --sdcard=/dev/sd?
$ pmbootstrap export
$ git clone https://github.com/shakalaca/ZenFone-boot-tools
$ cd ZenFone-boot-tools
$ make
$ ./pack_intel ./path/to/original/boot.img /tmp/postmarketOS-export/vmlinuz-asus-t00f /tmp/postmarketOS-export/initramfs-asus-t00f output_boot.img
</syntaxhighlight>

Then you can flash output_boot.img as you normally would using fastboot.

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ sudo fastboot flash boot output_boot.img
</syntaxhighlight>
