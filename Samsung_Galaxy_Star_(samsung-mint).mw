== What works ==
* Building system (without Mali and UMP drivers, also some modules are not found in <code>/lib/modules/3.0.101</code>, here's a list of them: <code>drm, drm_kms_helper, dm-crypt, ext4</code>)

== What does not work ==
* Anything

== What is not properly tested\or doesn't confirmed to work ==
* Booting (stuck at bootloader logo, boots in TWRP successfully, backlight doesn't change)

== How to enter flash mode ==
1. Hold Volume Down + Home + Power buttons for 6 seconds

2. Phone will display [[Media:Mint_bootloader_warn.jpg|this warning]]. Pres Volume Up button to continue

3. If anything is right, then phone will display [[Media:Mint_bootloader.jpg|this screen]].

== Installation ==
There are no ready releases, so you need to build your own pmOS image (it's not that long)

== Building ==
You should to:

1. Install Git and Python

2. <strike>Clone [https://github.com/mishaor/pmbootstrap my pmbootstrap fork] (warning: it's very old)</strike> (gone forever from GitHub)

3. Change directory to your newly cloned repository

4. Follow the official build guide

== Photos ==
No photos of device booting postmarketOS
