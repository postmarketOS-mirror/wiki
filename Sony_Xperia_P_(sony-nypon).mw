== Issues ==
The device seems to be having issue with unpacking ramdisk when CONFIG_VT is enabled for some reason.
When being connected via UART i can see the kernel trying to do something with the ramdisk but it fails. Disabling CONFIG_VT it goes to crazy mode as /dev/tty isnt there and spams the log with that.
