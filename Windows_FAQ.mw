Most postmarketOS developers use pmbootstrap on a bare-metal Linux installation. This page notes some quirks you may have to deal with when running pmbootstrap in a Linux distribution inside a VM like VirtualBox.

== Can I use pmbootstrap in WSL? ==

No.

== If your device gets detected as ADB Interface/Recovery ==
1. Click Update Driver - choose "Composite USB Device"("Составное USB Устройство" in Russian locale of Windows)

2. Unknown device with name RNDIS device would appear
== Installing RNDIS ==

1. Click Update Driver - choose "Browse my computer for driver software." and then "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer."

2. Choose "Network Adapter" section

3. Choose "Microsoft" manufacturer

4. Choose "Remote NDIS compatible device"
: On Windows 10 version 1709, the device is "Remote NDIS based Internet Sharing Device"

5. That's all! Wait for Windows to install driver for your device and SSH into it!

== Using PuTTY instead of the Terminal inside the VM ==
If your phone only connects successfully to the VM, but you want to use PuTTY (or another Windows SSH client) for Telnet/SSH:
* Start a SSH server in the VM
* Connect via PuTTY to the VM
* Then connect to the device from that SSH session
