== What works ==

* Compiling the kernel
* Fastboot flash
* SSH
* Setting Brightness

'''Current status''': The framebuffer doesent seem to work correctly (it just sits on boot logo) running cat <code>/dev/urandom &gt; /dev/fb0</code> does nothing and running <code>cat /dev/urandom &gt; /dev/fb2</code> makes the screen go black<br />
the same happens with <code>cat /sys/devices/virtual/graphics/fb0/mode &gt; /sys/devices/virtual/graphics/fb0/modes</code>

'''What i've tried''':

* Using 3.10 instead of 3.4 (Gives same isue as anami -&gt; [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/348/files try out this fix!])
* Setting fb settings same as twrp (does nothing)
