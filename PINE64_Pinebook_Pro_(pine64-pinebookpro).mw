== Serial console ==
The Pinebook Pro has a serial port on the headphone connector, it's enabled by removing the bottom cover of the laptop and setting the UART switch towards the touchpad.

The uart is 1500000n8

The pinout for the serial connector on the laptop side is:

* Tip: RX
* Ring: TX
* Sleeve: GND

The serial connection is 3.3V

You can also buy the debug cable from [https://store.pine64.org PINE64 Store]

== Storage ==

The SD card is /dev/mmcblk2 and the eMMC is /dev/mmcblk0

== Video acceleration ==

The rockchip rk3399 soc in the Pinebook Pro has a hardware video encoder and decoder called hantro, the open implementation supports mpeg2, h264 and h265 but not all profiles are supported on these codecs.

The hardware decoder can be used in any media player that supports libva like vlc or mpv, the extra module that's needed is libva-v4l2-request https://github.com/bootlin/libva-v4l2-request from bootlin.
After building and installing v4l2_request_drv_video.so the decoder can be enabled by adding these environment variables:

<source lang="shell-session">
$ export LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=v4l2_request
$ export LIBVA_V4L2_REQUEST_VIDEO_PATH=/dev/video1
$ mpv --hwdec video-file.mp4
</source>
