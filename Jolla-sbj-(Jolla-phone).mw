=== What works ===

* Compiling the kernel from the jolla sources which should provide everything to run wayland since that's what sailfish uses

=== What does not work ===

* Flashing, still need to find the correct offsets

=== Flashing mode ===

The jolla does use fastboot from the mer project instead of android. To enter fastboot shut down the device, then plug in the USB lead while holding down volume down.
