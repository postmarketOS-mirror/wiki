== To do ==
{{note|informations below may be chaotic and change often}}

=== SMSM_RESET ===
Most annoying problem sunce everything on the phone has to be done within 2 minutes.
After about 2mins 22secs phone reboots with dmesg showing ''SMSM: Modem SMSM state changed to SMSM_RESET''
This message is hardcoded into ''arch/arm/mach-msm/smd.c''
Check what causes if, if it can be avoided by hanging defconfig or adding some drivers/blobs


=== Touch screen ===
The screen as well as two touch buttons (menu and back) are combined together as ''/dev/input/event1''.
It displays some sort of animation when pressing buttons in postmarket demos window in weston but only for first press or two.
''weston-calibrate'' does not work


Home button and volume buttons are ''/dev/input/event1'', where power button is recognised as ''/dev/input/event6''

=== Mainline ===
Currently we have working 2.6 kernel, no DTS files for qcom-msm7227a.

Get data form all over the kernel source code (mainly ''arch/mach-msm/board-<board name>.c'' for starters and recreate it in .dts file(s).

''Documentation/devicetree/'' inside linux kernel files, should contain newest documentation about dts files, should be most reliable source of information
