== What works ==
* It boots
* SSH through USB 
* display
* flashing

== What does not work ==
* Restart after ~2 minutes 22 seconds (probably ''SMSM: Modem SMSM state changed to SMSM_RESET'', message from file ''arch/arm/mach-msm/smd.c'' )
* No input (keys and screen)
* No charging with turned off phone (is it even supported?)

== To do ==
* Fixing 2:22 restarts is a priority
** the first thing that comes to my head is checking defconfig

* Touch screen input, /dev/input/event1 should be screen, still nothing is working, including weston-calibrate
** actually animation happens when pressing on buttons in weston demo menu but only once on first press, then nothing
