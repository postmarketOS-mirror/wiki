== To do ==
{{note|informations below may be chaotic and change often}}

=== SMSM_RESET ===
Most annoying problem sunce everything on the phone has to be done within 2 minutes.
After about 2mins 22secs phone reboots with dmesg showing ''SMSM: Modem SMSM state changed to SMSM_RESET''
This message is hardcoded into ''arch/arm/mach-msm/smd.c''

Probably caused my modem, check all MODEM and MSM*_MODEM_* related options in menuconfig (there is one called reset, one reboot and one just modem) or find binary blobs if possible.

=== Touch screen ===
The screen as well as two touch buttons (menu and back) are combined together as ''/dev/input/event1''.
It displays some sort of animation when pressing buttons in postmarket demos window in weston but only for first press or two.
''weston-calibrate'' does not work

Home button and volume buttons are ''/dev/input/event1'', where power button is recognised as ''/dev/input/event6''

=== Mainline ===
Currently we have working 2.6 kernel, no DTS files for qcom-msm7227a.

Get data form all over the kernel source code (mainly ''arch/mach-msm/board-<board name>.c'' for starters and recreate it in .dts file(s).

Get UART working, then test basic DTS with just basics to get earlycon/earlyprintk working:

* used voltage is 1.8V
* needed resistor is *probably* 619kΩ
* unknown name of the port in original kernel, candidates are ttyMSM0, tty0, ttyHS0, ttyHSL0 and ttyGS0
{{note|This dtb file goal is to get working UART, nothing more, rest of the work will be continued on regular git repository when/if UART starts working}}

==== Useful links (mainly dts stuff) ====
[[The_Mainline_Kernel|The Mainline Kernel]] – our docs about mainlining

[[Qualcomm_mainline_porting|Qualcomm mainline porting]] — our sparse docs about Qualcomm mainlining

[https://elinux.org/Qualcomm_SOC_Mainlining_Project Qualcomm SOC Mainlining Project] – sadly no MSM7227a

''Documentation/devicetree/'' inside linux kernel files, should contain newest documentation about dts files, should be most reliable source of information

== How to enter flash mode ==
Press power button and hold home button and VOL-, then press VOL+ to continue

Alternatively, plug in microUSB plug with GND and ID pins connected through 300KΩ resistor. (so-called USB jig)

== Installation ==
For now see [[Installation_guide|Installation Guide]] and [[Porting_to_a_new_device#Flashing|Flashing on Porting to a new device]]
