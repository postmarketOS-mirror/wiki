== Serial console ==

There is a 3.3V uart on the 2x5pin connector near the modem. The pin in the corner toward VOL- is GND and the next pin is TX.

[[File:Pine-dontbeevil-uart.jpg|frameless]]

The baudrate in u-boot and in Linux is 115200n8

On a functional devkit with a pmos SD card inserted you should get the standard u-boot console messages on the serial port as soon as you power the devkit on, and after that the linux kernel messages.

=== Touchscreen ===

The touchscreen is controlled by the <code>edt_ft5x06</code> module on i2c-0. The current issue is that it takes a long while before the i2c-0 bus works after booting. For some reason it takes ~110 seconds before communication is possible. This causes an issue because the module tries to probe the touchscreen before the bus works. 

The current workaround is to build <code>edt_ft5x06</code> as a module and rmmod/modprobe the module after the i2c-0 bus works so it gets probed again.

<source lang="dmesg">
[   17.942111] edt_ft5x06 0-0038: touchscreen probe failed
...after rmmod edt_ft5x06; modprobe edt_ft5x06...
[ 3989.326377] input: generic ft5x06 (12) as /devices/platform/soc/1c2ac00.i2c/i2c-0/0-0038/input/input2
</source>

The communication to the touchscreen controller is only possible when power is supplied the the 4G modem using the hardware switch (the light should be off) since the power rail for the 4G modem is used as pull-up for the i2c bus that connects the touchscreen controller to the sopine.

=== Cameras ===

The camera's both share the csi-0 bus. Currently only the rear camera (OV5640) has mainline linux support.

It's also not clear how the camera switching would work on the software side, maybe Linux just deals with it if the device tree nodes for the second camera get added.

The camera hardware pipeline is controlled with <code>/dev/media0</code> and <code>media-ctl</code>, the result is on <code>/dev/video0</code>

<source lang="shell-session">
pine-dontbeevil:~# media-ctl --set-v4l2 '"ov5640 2-003c":0[fmt:UYVY8_2X8/1280x720]'
pine-dontbeevil:~# ffmpeg -s 1280x720 -f video4linux2 -i /dev/video0 -vframes 1 selfie.jpg
</source>

=== Camera Flash ===

The camera flash consist out of a SG Micro SGM3140 "500mA Buck/Boost Charge Pump LED Driver" and a EHP-C04 LED.

The driver supports Flash and Torch mode, the first being brighter but only for about 300ms, when it switches to Torch mode. Torch mode is lower brightness but can be turned on continuously.

<source lang="shell-session">
# Turn on Flash, wait 0.3s, turn off
echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/sgm3140-flash/flash_strobe
sleep 0.3
echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/sgm3140-flash/flash_strobe
</source>

<source lang="shell-session">
# Turn on Torch
echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/sgm3140-flash/brightness
# Turn off Torch
echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/sgm3140-flash/flash_strobe
</source>


=== WiFi ===

WiFi generally works but the driver is quite sporadic when it wants to work. Rebooting/rmmod and modprobe'ing the driver/rfkill block - unblock helps.

<source lang="dmesg">

=== Bluetooth ===

There is a patch series on lkml. A v2 for this series is in progress.

=== Modem ===

Receiving text messages works. Calls should work too but weren't tested yet.

=== Sensors ===

All sensors work and are accessible as Industrial I/O (iio) devices in linux. To query the data you can cat the files in `/sys/bus/iio/` to make the kernel module query the sensors

<source lang="shell-session">
dontbeevil:~# cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/name
mpu6050
dontbeevil:~# cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/in_accel_z_raw
-17594
dontbeevil:~# echo "Verified gravity still exists"
</source>

=== RGB Led ===

The RGB led works with the led driver, but due to hardware bugs there can be only one led active at the same time and the blue led doesn't work because some pins are reversed.
<source lang="shell-session">
# Activate LED
echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/$COLOR/brightness
# Deactivate LED
echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/$COLOR/brightness
</source>

=== Audio ===

==== Speakers ====

Sound output should work after unmuting <code>AIF1 Slot 0 digital</code>

==== Mic ====

Doesn't work yet.

=== USB ===
Doesn't work for MartijnBraam, reported to work for other people.
