== Connecting ==
Power on your device and connect it to your USB port. pmOS uses the USB interface as a network interface and runs a DHCP server on it and <code>dmesg</code> will show something like

You should have the IP <code>172.16.42.2</code> assigned to your PC, check it with <code>ip a</code> or <code>ifconfig</code>:

<source lang="shell-session">
$ ip a
1: enp0s19f2u1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.16.42.2/24 brd 172.16.42.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute enp0s19f2u1
       valid_lft 861920sec preferred_lft 861920sec
    inet6 fe80::aabb:ccdd:eeff:00aa/64 scope link noprefixroute
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
</source>

It the interface doesn't automatically get an IP address on your system (for example on systems without NetworkManager) you need to start a dhcp client to get one. Replace the interface name with the one on your machine. Some Linux distributions have <code>dhcpcd</code> installed instead of <code>dhclient</code>.
<source lang="shell-session">
$ dhclient -v enp0s20f0u1
</source>
If this fails, you may need to first assign an ethernet address to it:

<source lang="shell-session">
# ip l set enp0s20f0u1 address 12:12:12:12:12:12
</source>
Then you can try the above <code>dhclient</code> command.

== SSH ==
{{note|There is a dedicated article for [[Inspecting_the_initramfs|inspecting the initramfs]] via telnet.}}

When you are past the initramfs, you should be able to connect via <code>ssh</code> and the password you set during the install phase:

<source lang="shell-session">
$ ssh user@172.16.42.1
user@172.16.42.1's password:
