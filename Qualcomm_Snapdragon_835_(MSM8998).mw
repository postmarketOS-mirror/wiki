[https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon-835-mobile-platform MSM8998] (or Snapdragon 835) is a high-end Qualcomm SoC released in 2017 with mainline support originally added for the [https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/10586661/ MTP (proven reference design) board] towards the end of 2018.

== UFS internal storage ==
To enable the device's internal UFS 2.1 host controller (& 14nm UFS QMP PHY), compile the kernel with the following modules enabled:
 CONFIG_SCSI_UFS_QCOM=y
 CONFIG_PHY_QCOM_QMP=y
 CONFIG_PHY_QCOM_UFS=y

You can optionally set <code>CONFIG_SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC=y</code> for some additional speedup while booting. Consider also enabling <code>CONFIG_QFMT_V2</code> if you intend on writing data to a <code>userdata</code> partition formatted by Android where disk quotas are normally enabled by default for <code>ext4</code> volumes.

== Bluetooth ==
Getting Bluetooth to work should be trivial assuming you compile the kernel with the following modules enabled:
 CONFIG_RFKILL=m
 CONFIG_BT_RFCOMM=y
 CONFIG_BT_BNEP=y
 CONFIG_BT_HIDP=y
 CONFIG_BT_HS=y
 CONFIG_BT_LE=y

After those are set and you've copied the needed kernel modules over to the rootfs in <code>/lib/modules/</code> you just need the following firmware files in <code>/lib/firmware/qca/</code>:
 crbtfw21.tlv
 crnv21.bin

Those can be supplied directly from <code>[https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/tree/qca linux-firmware]</code> and they should work fine, but if not you'll need to grab the files from your device's firmware partitions.
