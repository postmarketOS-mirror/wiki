== Maintainer(s) ==

== What works ==
* Kernel compilation (2.6.32.61)

== What does not work ==
* Everything else

== How to enter flash mode ==
* While holding Volume down, press and hold Power for 5-10 seconds. There are no visual cues when fastboot loads.

== Recovery mode ==
* While holding Volume up, press and hold Power button until recovery options appear.

== Installation ==
* Install system partition to SD card <code>pmbootstrap install --sdcard=/dev/sd?</code>
* Boot kernel using <code>pmbootstrap flasher boot</code>

== Issues ==
* Current assumption is that CPU is not supported by armhf architecture, so it won't boot [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/1203#note_85244831]
* boot.img that can be booted using fastboot boot command is the one from stock device image. CyanogenMod boot.img fails to boot, but works when flashed to device.
