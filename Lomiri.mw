The convergent desktop environment.

== Status ==

== Installation ==
{{note|The work on Unity 8 hasn't yet been finished yet - no support is provided}}

<source>
pmbootstrap install --add unity8,qt5-qtwayland,consolekit2
</source>

Once the device has launched, Unity 8 can be started with the following (as root):

<source>
# Run this (at least) once:
mkdir -p $HOME/.config/ubuntu-system-settings
touch $HOME/.config/ubuntu-system-settings/wizard-has-run
# Don't forget to set a password (passwd)!
</source>

<source>
# Run this for starting Unity 8:

export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/$(id -u)-runtime-dir
if ! test -d "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"; then
    mkdir "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"
    chmod 0700 "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"
fi

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/qt5/plugins/platforms
export MIR_SERVER_CURSOR=null
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=mirserver
export G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all
export QT_WAYLAND_DISABLE_WINDOWDECORATION=1
export MIR_MESA_KMS_DISABLE_MODESET_PROBE=1 # probably only needed in QEMU

ck-launch-session unity8
</source>

Auto-login would require lightdm to be set up or something 

Q: Should it be possible to launch unity8 as non-root user?

A: In principle, yes. The lightdm integration can be used to negotiate DRM master.
