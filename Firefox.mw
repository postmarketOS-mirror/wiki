postmarketOS ships the desktop version of Firefox as default in Phosh and Plasma Mobile, with a mobile and privacy friendly configuration.

== postmarketOS specific configuration ==
Besides the obvious change of the default homepage, the following things have been configured. To remove the postmarketOS specific configuration, uninstall the <code>postmarketos-config-firefox</code> package.

==== Mobile ====
* Enable zooming with fingers <small>(Change in about:config; apz.allow_zooming, apz.allow_double_tap_zooming, dom.w3c.touch_events.enabled)</small>
* Mobile user agent (from tor browser for android) <small>(Change in about:config; general.useragent.override)</small>

==== Privacy ====
* Disable search suggestions, so URLs do not get sent to search engines as they are getting typed. <small>(Change in Preferences)</small>
* Disable Firefox studies <small>(Change in Preferences)</small>
* Disable Telemetry <small>(Change in Preferences)</small>
* Set DuckDuckGo as default search engine <small>(Change in Preferences)</small>

==== Uncluttering ====
To save screen space, remove broken features, and have less distractions in the browser in general:
* Empty "new tab" page (loads faster, no annoying "top sites" etc.) <small>(Change in Preferences)</small>
* Move all buttons to the overflow menu and remove spacers around the address bar <small>(Change with >>, Customize Toolbar)</small>
* Disable developer tools, so the hamburger menu fits the screen of the pinephone. <small>(Change in /etc/firefox/policies/policies.json)</small>
* Disable "Firefox Screenshots": the feature did not work with the mobile resolution in Phosh. <small>(Change in /etc/firefox/policies/policies.json)</small>
* No default bookmarks from Firefox <small>(Change in /etc/firefox/policies/policies.json)</small>
* Disable First Run Page <small>(Change in /etc/firefox/policies/policies.json)</small>
* Disable Post Update Page <small>(Change in /etc/firefox/policies/policies.json)</small>
