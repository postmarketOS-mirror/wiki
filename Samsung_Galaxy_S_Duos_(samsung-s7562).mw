* cmdr2 on IRC

== What works ==

* Compilation of kernel, system and initramfs
* pmOS starts up if a pre-compiled kernel (from the original boot.img) is used, along with the newly built initramfs and system image. Telnet, decrypt filesystem, and ssh (partially) works

== What does not work ==

* pmOS does not boot with the newly built kernel. it only works if a pre-built factory kernel is used
* ssh fails with a 'cannot create channel 0' error, which can be bypassed with <code>ssh user@&lt;ip&gt; '/bin/sh'</code>. With this, no prompt is shown (i.e. no &quot;$&quot; or &quot;%&quot;), but commands can be typed and executed and the results are displayed
* No graphics are displayed on the screen, weston fails with <code>Failed to open frame buffer device ‘/dev/fb0’: No such file or directory</code>
