== How to enter flash mode ==
The original bootloader can't boot in fastboot mode so you need to flash a new one.
You can follow the instructions [https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox_OS/TCP/Flashing_the_Flatfish_bootloader here].

With the new bootloader, you can now boot into fast boot mode:
* Power off the device.
* Press and HOLD the power key (do not release until after the next step)
* When the boot logo (Firefox OS Contribution Program) appears, press and HOLD the Volume+ key until the Fastboot logo appears. You may now release both buttons.
