== Matchbox Window Manager ==

A major component of embedded Linux distributions targeted at handhelds and PDAs, such as OpenZaurus, the Ångström distribution, and even Maemo, was the Matchbox Window Manager.

The main raison d'être for Matchbox is that:
* It is very lightweight. It consumes a couple of MB of memory and has little CPU usage.
* It presents only one window at a time, like traditional PDA interfaces e.g. Palm OS.

=== Status ===

Its main components are as follows:

| libmatchbox
| 1.12
| Library for matchbox window manager
| The main library behind Matchbox. It is used so that window managers can use and customise its window management functionality without having to bundle the full matchbox-window-manager.
|-
! scope="row"| matchbox-common
| Ported
| matchbox-common
| 0_git20070606
| Common data files for Matchbox
| Includes files like the session, some basic configuration data like which directories are shown by the matchbox-desktop (via the [https://developer.gnome.org/integration-guide/stable/desktop-files.html.en Desktop Menu Specification]). It starts the panel, the desktop interface and the window manager.
|-
! scope="row"| matchbox-desktop
| Ported
| matchbox-desktop
| 2.0
| Desktop system for handhelds using the GTK+2 stack
| A desktop interface that runs behind the programs in Matchbox. The panel includes a home button that can bring this to the front, so that other programs can be switched to.
|-
! scope="row"| matchbox-keyboard
| Ported
| matchbox-keyboard
| 0.1.1
| An on-screen virtual keyboard
| It has GTK+2 and GTK+3 input method support, and can build a (currently non-working) panel applet for matchbox panel version 2. It also has cairo integration.
|-
! scope="row"| matchbox-panel
| Ported
| matchbox-panel
| 2.11_git20161123
| Simple GTK+3-based panel for handheld devices
| This is a rewrite of the original matchbox-panel. It has GTK+3 support. However, some of the panel applets don't work quite how they should, e.g. the systray is seemingly always empty. However, e.g. notifications show up and the user can press a button to view the desktop. Ideally they would be able to control system reboot/shutdown/logout from the panel, too.
|-
! scope="row"| matchbox-window-manager
| Ported
| matchbox-window-manager
| 2.0_git20171119
| Window manager intended for non-desktop embedded platforms such as handhelds and set-top boxes
| This is a rewrite of the original matchbox-window-manager. It removes xsettings support in favor of GTK+2 integration and also has PNG theme support (not enabled yet). It also has pango integration.

== The GPE Palmtop Environment ==

The GPE Palmtop Environment is a GTK+-based user interface for PDA devices. It's similar to OPIE (The Open Palmtop Integrated Environment) or QtMoko. GPE is designed to be extremely lightweight and small in size.

However, the last version of Debian that shipped the suite was Wheezy. The project appears to have suffered from a lack of maintainers, a trademark and copyright spat between the handhelds.org website and linuxtogo website, as well as very slow development. 

The GPE code is entirely unmaintained and has dependencies which are unmaintained, for instance SQLite versions from around 2005.
It also has its main configuration program running as setuid root, which presents quite a large attack surface for a simple program.
It also depended on non-standard components such as /etc/timezone (this is not portable to systems not based on Debian, let alone
POSIX-compliant Unix-like systems). 

Additionally, certain libraries, that the suite depends on, ship with some terrible security issues, for instance old versions of sqlite.

The most immediate problems, however are with compiling the thing. Many of the packages do not link properly or make assumptions about obscure glibc functions (such as the undocumented __isleap macro in glibc's time.h).

Another immediate problem is that the homepage for GPE is now gone. The source code archives that were used came from Debian. They appear to be the latest - they shipped with Debian Wheezy, which came out in May 2013.

=== Next steps ===

* Move from SQLite version 2 to modern SQLite version 3
* Move from gconf and xsettings to gsettings and dconf. O-hand made [https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/xsettings-daemon/ xsettings-daemon], a bridge between xsettings and gconf. This can be useful for GPE, as it makes heavy use of xsettings.
* Proper GTK theme support.
* Move to GTK+3. Reworking libgpewidget should do the trick. Getting rid of it altogether may be desirable.
* Move from the Enlightened sound daemon (esound) to PulseAudio or similar. In fact, esdcompat is part of pulseaudio-utils. So, we can build against esd development libraries, but not actually install esd itself.
* Fix dependencies on non-standard system infrastructure such as /etc/timezone.
* Investigate modern replacement for the audiofile program.
* Modern configuration program for wireless networking with privilege separation.
* GTK programs that don't use xsettings aren't able to be configured by its theme support (as far as it appears). Enhance gpe-conf to be able to do this (or get rid of the xsettings-based theme system and just use GTK+.)

=== Active issues ===
* Sound does not appear to work. This may be device-specific.
* Rewrite gpe-conf's passwd.c interface, as it seems to make assumptions that are incorrect about standard systems.
* Disk space isn't reported, just system memory usage (which arguably isn't very useful anyway)
* Battery status is not shown in gpe-conf. This appears to be because some parts of GPE are built around the old apmd system, which is now deprecated in favour of acpid.
* gpe-su always looks for the command <code>x-terminal-emulator</code>. A really dirty solution is to patch this to say <code>xterm</code> or similar. In Alpine, update-alternatives is actually provided by the dpkg package.

== Tracking PIM suite and mobile interface components ==

We should be able build a basic, lightweight system aimed at low-end PDA-like devices from Matchbox, GPE, and a few other components.

== Pimlico Project, Sync, and miscellaneous PIM applications ==

The Pimlico Project was created by OpenHand as part of their Sato Linux distribution (based on OpenEmbedded-core). Sato seems primarily based on OE-core, Matchbox, and Gnome components (this is related to the Gnome embedded initiative in ~2007).

* [https://git.gnome.org/dates Dates] - a calendar application
* [https://git.gnome.org/tasks Tasks] - plan tasks etc
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090817064327/http://pimlico-project.org:80/sources/contacts/ Contacts] - make a record of contact information
** Unfortunately, the last release, 0.9, appears to be lost forever. The file is not available on the internet archive, nor is it available on any mirror I could find. 0.8 is available on the internet archive, however.
* Sync - synchronise the applications with external sources
** Unfortunately, OpenHand's website is now defunct, so Sync's source code appears to be inaccessible there. However, Sync appears to have been mirrored at https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/sync/. That being said, it's not clear if they're the same program.
** Sync is based on the (seemingly) now-defunct OpenSync project, so it is probably not worth porting. Other mobile synchronisation programs such as KDEConnect are probably worth looking at.

Thoughts:
* It should be possible to make the programs use the modern Evolution data server.
* The programs may fit in nicely with existing GNOME components e.g. Evolution mail itself.

== GPE phone edition ==

There was also a now-defunct GPE phone edition. It provided Email, SMS, voicemail, and calling components. This could be useful.

== What about OPIE and others? ==

=== OPIE ===
OPIE is an alternative to GPE. It's similarly targeted at embedded systems and is similar in function. However, it uses QT Extended (QTE), which is no longer under active development, and does not compile on more recent systems, let alone under Musl.

* [https://github.com/opieproject/opie OPIE Project]

=== QTMoko ===
Another alternative is QTMoko. QTMoko is similar to OPIE but they forked QTE and now use a custom patched version of QT (Itself unmaintained). QTMoko is the fork of QTE for OpenMoko handsets. They are looking into moving away from this in the future, though, so this is probably a viable alternative.

* [https://www.mail-archive.com/gta04-owner@goldelico.com/msg00853.html Message about QTMoko potentially moving away from QTE]
* [http://projects.goldelico.com/p/gta04-qtmoko/ Maintained QTMoko (now at version 2)]

=== SHR ===
SHR is an OpenEmbedded-based system which combines Enlightenment with the freesmartphone stack, among other things. They use the illume2 Enlightenment module to make Enlightenment fit handhelds' form factor more easily, and provide an on-screen keyboard.

* [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/SHR SHR overview]
* [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/SHR_User_Manual SHR user manual]

A thought: It would be useful to port Enlightenment to Alpine at any rate. It can work as an X11 window manager or as a Wayland compositor, and it is used for instance by Tizen. However, it's codebase is "interesting", particularly the EFL libraries.
