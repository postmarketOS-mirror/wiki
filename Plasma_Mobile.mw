{{note|Plasma Mobile doesn't work on armhf due to an [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/issues/75 issue with <code>qt5-qtdeclarative</code>]. If your device is actually armv7 but still runs on armhf, please change it.}}

A mobile variant of the KDE Plasma [[User-Interfaces|user interface]], optimized for touchscreen.

== Status ==
{{note|Plasma Mobile is known to have problem with Android's framebuffer drivers (e.g. {{issue|1647}}). Works best with mainlined devices.}}
It works on most devices with a working display, both with hardware acceleration and software rendering. There is however an issue making it unable to run on armhf devices without hardware acceleration.

== Installation ==
Run <code>pmbootstrap init</code> and choose <code>plasma-mobile</code> in the interface section. If you already have postmarketOS installed, you can install Plasma Mobile by running <code># apk add postmarketos-ui-plasma-mobile</code>. Make sure you uninstall any other UI before you do this.

After installation, the shell will automatically launch upon boot using LightDM. If it doesn't, have a look at <code>$ logread | grep plasma-mobile</code> and <code>/usr/bin/plasma-phone</code>.

For the official KDE instructions on running Plasma Mobile, see [https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Mobile/RunningApps their website].

== Troubleshooting ==
=== Software rendering ===
Plasma can also be used if your device doesn't support hardware acceleration (if it's a non-armhf device) yet by using software rendering. Please note that the interface will be slow, and it might not be usable for the average user.

Software rendering will be enabled automatically if no hardware acceleration is detected, just make sure <code>mesa-dri-swrast</code> is installed.

=== Log output ===
You can read the log output with <code>logread -f</code>. Anything related to Plasma and KDE will have a <code>$username:plasma-mobile</code> prefix.

=== Logging isn't verbose ===
One needs to enable debug logging for certain components in <code>~/.config/QtProject/qtlogging.ini</code>. Without that, you barely see any log output. We [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/917f03d5f9f015fa9fc0be8093d87b7f21d98d4a/aports/main/postmarketos-ui-plasma-mobile/APKBUILD#L27 ship such a qtlogging.ini file] in <code>postmarketos-ui-plasma-mobile</code> because Plasma Mobile is relatively new and we want to be able to debug it properly.

If the file did not get installed for you, please double check if it is there and report in [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/1038 1038].

=== KWin doesn't work ===
{{note|Plasma Mobile shell uses some Wayland protocols, so you can't run it on X11 in case you tried to do that.}}
Please follow [https://blog.martin-graesslin.com/blog/2016/07/why-does-kwin_wayland-not-start/ these instructions] for debugging.

== Guide ==
Follow the [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Display Display] guide to change and fix display related issues.
