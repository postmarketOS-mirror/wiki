A mobile variant of the KDE Plasma [[User-Interfaces|user interface]], optimized for touchscreen.

== Status ==
The basic shell has been ported to postmarketOS, and can now be tested in Qemu. It also works on most devices with a working display, both with hardware acceleration and software rendering.

== Installation ==
Run <code>pmbootstrap init</code> and choose <code>plasma-mobile</code> in the interface section. The binary repo provided by the project already contains KDE builds for x86_64, armhf and aarch64 (compiling takes a long time). Nothing has to be done to enable it.

After installation, the shell will automatically launch upon boot. If it doesn't, have a look at <code>/etc/profile.d/start_plasma.sh</code> and <code>/usr/bin/plasma-phone</code>.

For the official KDE instructions on running Plasma Mobile, see [https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Mobile/RunningApps their website].

== Troubleshooting ==
=== Software rendering ===
Plasma can also be used if your device doesn't support hardware acceleration (if it's a non-armhf device) yet by using software rendering. Please note that the interface will be slow, and it might not be usable for the average user.

Software rendering will be enabled automatically if no hardware acceleration is detected, just make sure <code>mesa-dri-swrast</code> is installed.

=== Log output ===
You can read the log output with <code>logread -f</code>. Anything related to Plasma and KDE will have a <code>username:plasma-mobile</code> prefix.

==== Logging isn't verbose ====
One needs to enable debug logging for certain components in <code>~/.config/QtProject/qtlogging.ini</code>. Without that, you barely see any log output. We [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/917f03d5f9f015fa9fc0be8093d87b7f21d98d4a/aports/main/postmarketos-ui-plasma-mobile/APKBUILD#L27 ship such a qtlogging.ini file] in <code>postmarketos-ui-plasma-mobile</code> because Plasma Mobile is relatively new and we want to be able to debug it properly.

If the file did not get installed for you, please double check if it is there and report in {{github|1038}}.

=== KWin doesn't work ===
{{note|Plasma Mobile shell uses some Wayland protocols, so you can't run it on X11 in case you tried to do that.}}
Please follow [https://blog.martin-graesslin.com/blog/2016/07/why-does-kwin_wayland-not-start/ these instructions] for debugging.
