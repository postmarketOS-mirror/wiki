== How to enter flash mode ==
Hold Accept and Power buttons to enter fastboot.

== Issues ==
* It's not possible to control screen brightness/disable screen;
* The keyboard maximum brightness is very low.

== Installation ==

Install pmOS on microSD with
<code>pmbootstrap install --sdcard /dev/mmcblkX</code>
where /dev/mmcblkX is path to card that can be found with lsblk.
Insert card in device, enter fastboot as written above and run
<source>pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel
fastboot reboot</source>

<code>fastboot boot</code> doesn't work as intended.

== Kernels ==
This section may be interesting for those who want to port postmarketOS on SP7715GA device.
I've tried some downstream kernels and there are my findings:
* [https://github.com/bigzz/sc7715-kernel bigzz/sc7715-kernel]: boots, but doesn't support sdcardFS. UbiFS partitions weren't detected despite having related options set up in kernel config. This kernel may be used if your phone doesn't use ubiFS and you plan to flash pmOS on internal storage.
* BLU kernel: supports sdcardFS, doesn't detect ubiFS partitions. Being used for this device as the best suiting kernel.
* [https://github.com/diepquynh/android_kernel_oc_vivalto3gvn samsung-vivalto3gvn kernel]: has defconfig only for vivalto, so it needs to be adjusted to fit sp7715ga. Has updated and refactored implementation of sprdfb. Screen doesn't work, the bootloader and kernel seem to not fit each other, so kernel decides to use panel_id=0, which leads to using lcd_dummy driver. Also, the kernel is very unpredictable and booted only once for me, even though I didn't rebuild it for other attempts.
* [https://github.com/blade-af3/android_kernel_zte_P731A20 Blade AF3 kernel]: has building issues with autotst driver.
