== How to enter flash mode ==
Hold Accept and Power buttons to enter fastboot.

== Issues ==
* UbiFS partitions are not detected, so only sdcard installation will work
* Display output is corrupted

== Installation ==

Install pmOS on microSD with
<code>pmbootstrap install --sdcard /dev/mmcblkX</code>
where /dev/mmcblkX is path to card that can be found with lsblk.
Insert card in device, enter fastboot as written above and run
<source>pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel
fastboot reboot</source>

<code>fastboot boot</code> doesn't work as intended.
