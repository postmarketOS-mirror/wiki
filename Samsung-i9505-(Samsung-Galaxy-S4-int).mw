== How to enter flash mode ==

Press volume down + the power button to enter Download Mode. It is now possible
to use Heimdall for flashing.

== Installation ==

# <pre>git clone git@github.com:postmarketOS/pmbootstrap.git && cd pmbootstrap</pre>
# <pre>./pmbootstrap.py init</pre>
# <pre>./pmbootstrap.py install --no-fde</pre>
# Put your S4 in Download Mode (Volume Down + Power) and connect it with USB
# <pre>./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_kernel</pre>
# <pre>./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_rootfs</pre>

== Wifi ==

Once the device has been successfully initialized, enable it:

<pre>$ sudo ip link set wlan0 up</pre>
Configure wpa_supplicant (only necessary on encrypted networks):

<pre>$ sudo su -
# wpa_passphrase $YOUR_SSID &gt; /etc/wpa_supplicant/wlan0.conf
&lt;enter passphrase here and press Enter&gt;
# exit</pre>
Connect to network using wpa_supplicant:

<pre>$ sudo wpa_supplicant -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wlan0.conf </pre>
If your network uses DHCP, start the DHCP client:

<pre>$ sudo udhcpc -i wlan0</pre>
