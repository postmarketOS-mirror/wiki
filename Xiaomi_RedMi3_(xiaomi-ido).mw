== What works ==

* Boots
* USB Networking
* osk-sdl works to unlock root partition
* battery
* weston starts and displays shit, couldn't be fucked to configure eudev for it yet, so touchscreen works only in osk-sdl, not on weston yet. Easy to fix though.

== What does not work ==

* everything else is untested
