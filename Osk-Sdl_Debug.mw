osk-sdl is an on-screen keyboard built primarily for running in initfs and aiding users with unlocking the rootfs LUKS device from a touch screen device.

It currently lives in the <code>add_osk_initramfs</code> branch of <code>pmbootstrap</code>.

To install it:

<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap.git
$ git checkout feature/add_osk_initramfs
$ ./pmbootstrap init
<select device options>
<Note: It's helpful to select 'none' here for UI so that osk-sdl can be run from within pmos without conflicting with weston>
$ ./pmbootstrap install --no-fde
</pre>

Using <code>--no-fde</code> will allow pmOS to boot straight into rootfs without requiring unlocking of the partition. This seems counter-intuitive for testing a keyboard made for initramfs, but this will allow you to manually run osk-sdl with various environment options set and/or osk.conf options for debug and testing.

To run osk-sdl from pmOS (not in initramfs):

<pre>
$ sudo su
# export SDL_VIDEO_GL_DRIVER="libGL.so.1"
# export DFBARGS="system=fbdev,no-cursor,linux-input-grab"
# export TSLIB_TSDEVICE=/dev/input/eventX
# osk-sdl -d a -n a -c /etc/osk.conf -v
</pre>

Note: TSLIB_TSDEVICE should point to your touchscreen device, e.g. /dev/input/event3
