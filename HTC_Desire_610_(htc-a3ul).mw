== How to enter flash mode ==

One needs to install via android recovery zips, please enter into TWRP for flashing. To access fastboot, hold power and volume down at the same time for 5-10 seconds.

== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->
One needs to copy the dtb from TWRP. The procedure is identical to the [[HTC Desire 816 single SIM (htc-a5ul)]]. pmbootstrap install must be ran with --android-recovery-zip, as flashing does not work via fastboot.
