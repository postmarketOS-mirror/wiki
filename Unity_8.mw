The convergent desktop environment.

== Status ==
Still being packaged. All required individual packages are packaged but configuration is needed. Here is the latest update [https://github.com/z3ntu/ubuntu-app-launch/commits/bionic page]

== Installation ==
{{note|The work on Unity 8 hasn't yet been merged to the master branch, but it's available in <code>feature/unity8</code>}}


<source>
pmbootstrap config ui unity8 # Assuming the pmbootstrap init step has already been done, otherwise just select "unity8" as user interface
</source>

Once the device has launched, Unity 8 can be started with the following (as root):

<source>
# set a password (passwd)!

cp /etc/profile.d/start_unity8.sh .
# patch out the "if [ $(tty)" and the corresponding "fi" out of ./start_unity8.sh

sh ./start_unity8.sh
</source>

Auto-login would require lightdm to be set up or something 

Q: Should it be possible to launch unity8 as non-root user?

A: In principle, yes. The lightdm integration can be used to negotiate DRM master.
