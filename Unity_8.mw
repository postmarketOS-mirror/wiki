The convergent desktop environment.

== Status ==
Still being packaged. All required individual packages are packaged but configuration is needed. Here is the latest update [https://github.com/z3ntu/ubuntu-app-launch/commits/bionic page]

== Installation ==
Since it isn't yet finished, there is no UI meta package for it yet and it can not be selected in <code>pmbootstrap</code>. It can however be installed manually for now.

<source>
pmbootstrap config ui none # Assuming the pmbootstrap init step has already been done, otherwise just select "none" as user interface
pmbootstrap install --add unity8
</source>

Once the device has launched, Unity 8 can be started with the following:

<source>
# "unity7-schemas"
wget -O /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/com.canonical.Unity.gschema.xml https://pastebin.com/raw/y2hMw9qq
glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas


if test -z "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"; then
  export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/$(id -u)-runtime-dir
  if ! test -d "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"; then
    mkdir "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"
    chmod 0700 "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"
  fi

export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket
