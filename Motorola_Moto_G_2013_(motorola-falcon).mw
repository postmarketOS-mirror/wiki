== Installing ==

There appears to be no special process to flashing the device, as long as [https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/standalone/bootloader/unlock-your-device-a/ the bootloader is unlocked first]

Once you're in fastboot by holding down {{Button|Volume Down}} + {{Button|Power}}, flashing it is as follows:

<source lang="bash">
$ pmbootstrap init
$ pmbootstrap install
$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs
$ pmbootstrap flasher boot 
</source>

You can also use <code> $ pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</code> to flash the kernel, however this breaks the charging splash screen

== Useful stuff ==

Similar to the [[Moto_G_2014_(motorola-titan)|Moto G 2014]], the LED can be controlled:

<source lang="bash">$ echo 255 > /sys/devices/leds-qpnp-rgb-e1dba000/leds/white/brightness</source>

== TODO ==
* Try [[Tips_and_tricks#Update_the_architecture_of_your_device|updating the architecture]] to <code>armv7</code>
* Try [[Downstream_kernel_specific_package#Use_the_newest_GCC_from_Alpine|using the newest GCC from Alpine]]
* Test additional functionality, interfaces, etc.
* Maintain the device
