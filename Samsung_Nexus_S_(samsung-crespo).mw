== How to enter flash mode ==
Hold volup+power to power up in bootloader/fastboot mode.

== Installation ==
The Nexus S fastboot flasher mode cannot be used to flash the system (rootfs) image, for two reasons:
* There is a size limit of ~340MB (RAM limitation I assume)
* The system image generated is rejected by the bootloader (bad magic number error)

So we can use the recovery zip flashing method, except for the boot.img (kernel+initramfs) as the pmos install script fails to correctly find the boot partition.

Thus, we use fastboot to flash the boot.img, and use recovery zip to flash the rootfs.

Here are the instructions:

# Setup your pmos environment (pmbootstrap init)
# Generate the initramfs (pmbootstrap initfs build)
# Generate the recovery zip without boot partition (pmbootstrap install --android-recovery-zip --recovery-no-kernel)
# Put the device in fastboot mode
# Flash the boot partition (pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel)
# Reboot the device in recovery (e.g. TWRP v2.8.7.0) and enable "ADB Sideload"
# **temp fix** manually edit and flash the recovery zip (this won't be required once the script fix is merged)
## Make a copy of the recovery zip
## Edit the install script as per [https://gitlab.com/joeblos/postmarketos-android-recovery-installer/-/commit/10c161770923649552f29348ea35ff1fa1fcf513 this commit]
## Manually sideload the edited recovery zip (adb sideload pmos-samsung-crespo.zip)
# Done!
