The '''Google Nest''' has been made in several different versions, this page tries to document some initial research.

For the Nest Learning Thermostat, two tarballs where released for version 5.7:
* for the i.MX version, DTS files attributed to Nest Labs are located in <code>/arch/arm/boot/dts/onyx-*</code>
* the OMAP version is based on board files, some Nest Labs attributed files are located in <code>/arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-diamond-*</code> According to <code>board-diamond.c</code> the board is forked from an OMAP3 EVM. This file contains quite some documentation about the board.

The Nest userspace has been implemented in an open source project: https://github.com/luke-jr/freeabode

== TODO ==
* document revisions/SKUs of the Nest per SoC
* add unlock info
