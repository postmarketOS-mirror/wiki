== What works ==

* Display (framebuffer), 16 bit color depth
* Touchscreen
* USB networking
* vibrator
* X11 (tested with xfce4)

== Audio ==

Using ucm configuration files from [https://github.com/w-flo/rootfs-modifier/tree/master/replacements/targz/usr/share/alsa/ucm/msm-audio] it is possible to turn on the speaker, which then produces a very faint noise. However, trying to play sound using aplay or speaker-test does not work.
