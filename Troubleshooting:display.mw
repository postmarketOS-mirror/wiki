== Changing the panning ==
Some devices might have a framebuffer virtual size thats twice as big as the panel resolution, this is a common double buffering method. The application renders to one side of the display while the panning is set to
the other side. You can try changing the panning with the `panning` file in the sysfs directory.

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/virtual_size
todo: add file contents here
$ cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/pan
todo: add file contents here
$ echo 0 0 > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/pan

== MSM framebuffer doesn't work ==

We found out that removing the 3D driver support makes the MSM framebuffer work. See [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/66 #66].

<pre>CONFIG_MSM_KGSL=n</pre>

On devices using the mdss_fb driver, adding <code>mdss-fb-init-hack</code> to the dependencies of the device package ([https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/405b702e322088e2e4ee74b3738fce19e53782cc/aports/device/device-sony-amami/APKBUILD#L8 example]) might help.

== Screen output flicker and inactivity ==

If you notice a very brief flicker upon boot, but immediately disappears and screen turns black, you might have a buggy framebuffer Qualcomm MDSS MDP3 driver.

You can try patching the source code by removing the function assigned to the <code>mdp3_interface->off_fnc</code> in the <code>mdp3_ctrl.c</code> file.

See example patch: [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/master/aports/device/linux-huawei-y530/05_fix_mdp3_ctrl_off.patch 05_fix_mdp3_ctrl_off.patch]

== Screen output messed up ==

If the output on the screen is not aligned correctly ([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/315080/30261765-c28df28e-96d6-11e7-971a-fd031704a810.jpg see picture]) it's probably because you have a wrong value in <code>/sys/class/graphics/fb0/bits_per_pixel</code>.

You can try patching the source code by setting a different video mode (RGB/ARGB/RGBA/YCRYCB/...).

This may also help, when your X11 is segfaulting (see {{github|779}}).

See example patch: [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/master/aports/device/linux-huawei-y530/06_fix_mdss_fb_rgb_mode.patch 06_fix_mdss_fb_rgb_mode.patch]

== My screen is red! ==
Patch your kernel to report the right framebuffer information, for example with the following patch. If you have successfully patched your kernel that way, please edit this page and link to the merge request below (so we get a few more examples).

Alternative patch: [https://cascardo.eti.br/patches/0001-fix-video-argb-setting.patch 0001-fix-video-argb-setting.patch] (requires <code>CONFIG_FB_MSM_DEFAULT_DEPTH_ARGB8888=y</code> in the kernel config).

A workaround might be setting the default color depth to 16 bits per pixel (see [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/merge_requests/132#note_133044017 this comment]).

== Screen doesn't refresh ==

Check if your screen refreshes when you do the following:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/modes > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/mode
</syntaxhighlight>

If it does, add <code>msm-fb-refresher</code> to the <code>depends=</code> of your device-package. It will basically do the same automatically.

(If the above command does ''not'' refresh your screen, you could try the <code>msm-fb-refresher</code> anyway.)

{{note|Make sure you zap the device rootfs after enabling the msm refresher, otherwise it will only get installed as a service and not enabled by the postmarketos-base install script (you'll only see a second of splash-screen otherwise and the refresher won't be restarted after exiting the initramfs}}

== Screen is blank outside of Weston ==
Something like that should help, see [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/603#issuecomment-333327128 #603]:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ echo 0 > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/blank
$ echo 1 > /sys/devices/fd900000.qcom,mdss_mdp/qcom,mdss_fb_primary.134/leds/lcd-backlight/brightness
</syntaxhighlight>

== Debugging the kernel driver ==
If you have some time to spend on getting your video driver working right, consider adding <code>printk</code> statements in your kernel to understand what it does and where it fails. After building your kernel and flashing, check <code>dmesg</code> for your debug output. See [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/1618#note_88908569 #1618 (comment)] for a detailed example.
