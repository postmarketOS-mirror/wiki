==== Changing the panning ====
Some devices might have a framebuffer virtual size thats twice as big as the panel resolution, this is a common double buffering method. The application renders to one side of the display while the panning is set to
the other side. You can try changing the panning with the `panning` file in the sysfs directory.

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/virtual_size
todo: add file contents here
$ cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/pan
todo: add file contents here
$ echo 0 0 > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/pan

==== MSM framebuffer doesn't work ====

We found out that removing the 3D driver support makes the MSM framebuffer. See [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/66 #66].

<pre>CONFIG_MSM_KGSL=n</pre>

On devices using the mdss_fb driver, adding <code>mdss-fb-init-hack</code> to the dependencies of the device package ([https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/405b702e322088e2e4ee74b3738fce19e53782cc/aports/device/device-sony-amami/APKBUILD#L8 example]) might help.

==== Screen output flicker and inactivity ====

If you notice a very brief flicker upon boot, but immediately disappears and screen turns black, you might have a buggy framebuffer Qualcomm MDSS MDP3 driver.

You can try patching the source code by removing the function assigned to the <code>mdp3_interface->off_fnc</code> in the <code>mdp3_ctrl.c</code> file.

See example patch: [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/master/aports/device/linux-huawei-y530/05_fix_mdp3_ctrl_off.patch 05_fix_mdp3_ctrl_off.patch]

==== Screen output messed up ====

If the output on the screen is not aligned correctly ([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/315080/30261765-c28df28e-96d6-11e7-971a-fd031704a810.jpg see picture]) it's probably because you have a wrong value in <code>/sys/class/graphics/fb0/bits_per_pixel</code>.

You can try patching the source code by setting a different video mode (RGB/ARGB/RGBA/YCRYCB/...).

This may also help, when your X11 is segfaulting (see {{github|779}}).

See example patch: [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/master/aports/device/linux-huawei-y530/06_fix_mdss_fb_rgb_mode.patch 06_fix_mdss_fb_rgb_mode.patch]

==== My screen is red! ====

There are some buggy framebuffer drivers (e.g. in LG Nexus 5) that report incorrect data. You can override it with:

<pre>weston --pixman-type=2</pre>
More information on [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/54 issue #54]

You can set <code>deviceinfo_weston_pixman_type</code> (see [[deviceinfo reference]]) to enable this workaround.

==== Screen doesn't refresh ====

Check if your screen refreshes when you do the following:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/modes > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/mode
</syntaxhighlight>

If it does, enable <code>deviceinfo_msm_refresher</code> (see [[deviceinfo reference]]) and add <code>msm-fb-refresher</code> to the <code>depends=</code> of your device-package. It will basically do the same automatically.

(If the above command does ''not'' refresh your screen, you could try the <code>msm-fb-refresher</code> anyway.)

==== Screen is blank outside of Weston ====

Something like that should help, see [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/603#issuecomment-333327128 #603]:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ echo 0 > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/blank
