== How to enter flash mode ==

* You need to be bootloader unlocked via this method: https://forum.xda-developers.com/hd8-hd10/orig-development/unlock-fire-hd-8-2017-douglas-t3962846.
* After unlock, the normal fastboot doesn't let us flash in the required partitions? See notes on [[Amazon Fire HD 10 (amazon-suez)]].
* Holding vol down + power gets you into TWRP.
* Flash with the ADB sideload method.
* However, the default recovery.zip generated by pmbootstrap flashes into the boot partition, not the boot_x partition which is what is needed for this device. The recovery.zip file has to be manually editted to replace <code>boot</code> with <code>boot_x</code> in <code>chroot/install_options</code> and <code>chroot_bin/pmos_install_functions</code>. Again, see notes on [[Amazon Fire HD 10 (amazon-suez)]].
