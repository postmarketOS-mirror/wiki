== How to enter flash mode ==
First, boot phone into recovery mode.
To do that, power on while pressing both the up button and the power button.
When the logo apears, release the power button.

Once in the recovery mode, navigate to "reboot to bootloader" using the volume keys. <br/>
In my case, I had to validate pressing the power button twice, then the power up button.
