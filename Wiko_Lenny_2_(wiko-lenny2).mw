Current status: the device boot but doesn't show anything on screen. It seems to go past initramfs but don't give ssh access although it creates a network interface and it is possible to ping it.

TODO: make this an issue.

== How to enter flash mode ==
First, boot phone into recovery mode.
To do that, power on while pressing both the up button and the power button.
When the logo appears, release the power button.

Once in the recovery mode, navigate to "reboot to bootloader" using the volume keys. <br/>
In my case, I had to validate pressing the power button twice, then the power up button.

== Installation ==

The kernel and the initramfs can be flashed using <code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</code>. Flashing the rootfs [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/456 require a workaround]
