== How to enter flash mode ==
Hold Power and Vol down while booting

Select fastboot

== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->
Can't flash rootfs from fastboot, must be installed with flashable zip via recovery

The Device Tree image is not generated by pmbootstarp properly. Copying one from a LineageOS boot image into the initramfs then recompiling works.
