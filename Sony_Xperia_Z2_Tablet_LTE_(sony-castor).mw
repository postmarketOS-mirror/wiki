== Installation ==
=== Prerequisites ===
==== Unlock Bootloader ====
This might not work if the device is in factory settings, so setup Android once.
* open dialer and type <code>*#*#7378423#*#*</code>
* Service info → Configuration → Rooting Status
* check that bootloader unlock says "Yes" (otherwise, you cannot unlock)
* use the IMEI to retrieve the unlock code from the [https://developer.sony.com/develop/open-devices/get-started/unlock-bootloader/ Sony website]
* turn off device and disconnect USB (if connected)
* hold volume up and connect USB to computer to enter fastboot (LED should switch from red to blue)
* with the unlock code from the Sony website as <code>KEY</code>:
<source lang="bash">$ fastboot oem unlock 0xKEY</source>

==== Install pmbootstrap ====
* see [[Installing_pmbootstrap]]

=== Install postmarketOS ===
* turn off device and disconnect USB (if connected)
* hold volume up and connect USB to computer to enter fastboot (LED should switch from red to blue)
<source lang="bash">$ pmbootstrap init</source>
* select <code>sony</code> and <code>castor</code>
<source lang="bash">$ pmbootstrap install
$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs
$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</source>

==== Plasma Mobile ====
Set scaling to 3x:
<source lang="bash">$ kscreen-doctor output.1.scale.3</source>

=== Useful key combinations ===
* fastboot: volume up and connect USB
* hard shutdown: press and hold volume up and power
