== How to enter flash mode ==
At the moment, the recommended way is to flash postmarketOS to a SD card. The SD card needs to be manually prepared with the bootloader and necessary firmware. Then you can boot the board into Fastboot mode and flash postmarketOS normally from there.

=== Prepare SD card ===
{{note|'''WARNING:''' The SD card will be completely erased! Make sure to backup important data before you proceed.}}

First, connect the SD card to your PC and find out the device name (usually either <code>/dev/sdX</code> or <code>/dev/mmcblkX</code>). <code>lsblk</code> might be helpful. Make sure it is the correct device, since it will be entirely erased by the following commands.

Download https://releases.linaro.org/96boards/dragonboard410c/linaro/rescue/latest/dragonboard-410c-bootloader-sd-linux-*.zip and unpack it.

 <nowiki>$ git clone https://git.linaro.org/landing-teams/working/qualcomm/db-boot-tools.git
$ cd db-boot-tools
$ SD_CARD="/dev/sdX" # Replace this by your device name
$ sudo ./mksdcard -o "$SD_CARD" -p dragonboard410c/linux/partitions.txt -i ../dragonboard-410c-bootloader-sd-linux-* -s $(($(sudo blockdev --getsz "$SD_CARD") / 2))</nowiki>

Writing the SD card will take a while. Then insert it into the DragonBoard 410c and turn it on. Now you can connect a micro USB cable to get access to Fastboot.

If you want to access Fastboot again later (after flashing a boot image), press <code>Volume Down</code> before turning on the device.

== Installation ==
Follow the [[Installation guide]]. Use <code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs</code> and <code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</code> or <code>pmbootstrap flasher boot</code>.

{{note|'''Note:''' On the first boot the file system will be extended to span the entire SD card. This may take several minutes. You can see this if the disk LED (3) is active.}}

== Audio ==
See [[Qualcomm_Snapdragon_410_(MSM8916)#Audio]].

To play via HDMI, use <code>set _verb HDMI</code> or select HDMI in the PulseAudio mixer.
