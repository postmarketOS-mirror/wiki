=== Entering Fastboot mode ===

Turn on your watch and swipe from the top left corner (so thatd be where 11 would be on the watch) as soon as you see the LG logo.

=== Preperation ===

* Add <code>deviceinfo_flash_sparse="true"</code> the deviceinfo file
* Replace sshd with dropbear as seen in the [[USB Network]][https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/USB_Network] page

=== Flashing ===

Its important to remember to flash the system image to `userdata` as the system partition on the G Watch R is not big enough for pmOS. It will boot straight into pmOS once the kernel is flashed and the system is on userdata.

This is done by using:

* <code>pmbootstrap flasher export</code>
* <code>fastboot flash userdata /tmp/postmarketOS-export/device-name.img</code>
