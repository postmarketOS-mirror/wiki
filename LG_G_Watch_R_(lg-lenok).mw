=== Entering Fastboot mode ===

Turn on your watch and swipe from the top left corner (so thatd be where 11 would be on the watch) as soon as you see the LG logo.

=== Flashing ===

Its important to remember to flash the system image to `userdata` as the system partition on the G Watch R is not big enough for pmOS. It will boot straight into pmOS once the kernel is flashed and the system is on userdata.

=== What works ===

* Weston
* Touch screen
* Vibration motor? (if I hold the side button down for 5 seconds it vibrates...)

=== What doesn't work ===

* fbsplash (further research needed, LG logo is stuck on screen until weston is launched)
* The usual (wifi, bluetooth, everything else)
