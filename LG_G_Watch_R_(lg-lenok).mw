=== Entering Fastboot mode ===

Turn on your watch and swipe from the top left corner (so thatd be where 11 would be on the watch) as soon as you see the LG logo.

=== What works ===

* Weston (kind of, you need to alter panning once booted)
* Vibration motor? (if I hold the side button down for 5 seconds it vibrates...)

=== What doesn't work ===

* fbsplash (further research needed, LG logo is stuck on screen until weston is launched)
* Touch screen (Might be a simple fix, need to look into this further)
* The usual (wifi, bluetooth, everything else)
