=== Entering Fastboot mode ===

Turn on your watch and swipe from the top left corner (so thatd be where 11 would be on the watch) as soon as you see the LG logo.

=== Flashing ===

Its important to remember to flash the system image to `userdata` as the system partition on the G Watch R is not big enough for pmOS. It will boot straight into pmOS once the kernel is flashed and the system is on userdata.

This is done by using:

pmbootstrap flasher export

fastboot flash userdata /tmp/postmarketOS-export/device-name.img

=== What works ===

* Weston
* XWayland
* Touch screen
* Vibration motor? (if I hold the side button down for 5 seconds it vibrates...)

=== What doesn't work ===
* we still use the ugly "while true..." hack instead of msm-fb-refresher {{github|584}} (this is easy to fix: just remove the hack, use msm-fb-refresher instead and check if it is still working!)
* fbsplash (further research needed, LG logo is stuck on screen until weston is launched)
* The usual (wifi, bluetooth, everything else)
