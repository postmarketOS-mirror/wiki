== Installation ==

=== Boot process ===

We're using the <code>heimdall-isorec</code> flash method, see [[deviceinfo_flash_methods]] for more information.

==== netcat method ====
Flashing to device memory should be possible using [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/456 drebrez's netcat method (#456)] and [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_SII_(samsung-i9100) guide from Galaxy S II].

===== Step by step guide for Flashing to device memory =====

- Build image (on your computer) and prepare the installation as usual

  $ pmbootstrap init
  $ pmbootstrap build device-samsung-i9000 --arch=armhf
  $ pmbootstrap install --no-fde

-- Set phone to ODIN mode

-- Set image for NETCAT flash method

  $ pmbootstrap initfs hook_add debug-shell

-- Flash Kernel and Recovery (phone will reboot to screen "boot partition not found")

  $ pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel

-- Check USB network connection to phone

  ping 172.16.42.1

(if it does not ping, try replugging usb cable few times)

-- If USB network connection is still not up:
'' check for correct link with ip a''

  $ sudo ip l set enp0s20u2 address 12:12:12:12:12:12
  $ sudo dhclient -v enp0s20u2

-- Connect to phone with telnet

  $ telnet 172.16.42.1

-- Start netcat to listen for image (on the phone)
''/dev/mmcblk0p2 should be FACTORYFS partition you check by running fdisk -l /dev/mmcblk0''

  / # nc -v -l -p 60000 > /dev/mmcblk0p2

-- Switch to pmboostrap chroot (on the computer in other terminal)

  $ ./pmbootstrap.py chroot --suffix native

-- Install pv (in the chroot)

  / # apk add pv

-- Send image from computer to netcat (on the computer)

  / # pv /home/pmos/rootfs/samsung-i9000.img | nc 172.16.42.1 60000

-- Close both nc with CTRL+C when transfer finishes and reboot the phone with power button

=== Wifi ===

- Create conf for wpa_supplicant

  $ wpa_passphrase "SSID" "password" > wifi

Note : If you are connecting to a hidden wireless network, make sure to add line "scan_ssid=1" after the ssid line in your generated conf file

- Connect to wifi AP

  $ sudo wpa_supplicant -i wlan0 -c wifi &

- Get ip address from dhcp server (in another terminal)

  $ sudo udhcpc -i wlan0

To set wifi connection to start automatically on boot, please refer here [[wifi]]
