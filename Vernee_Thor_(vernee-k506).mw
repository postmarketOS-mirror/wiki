== How to enter flash mode ==
* '''Recovery:''' Power on the device with both {{Button|Power}}  and {{Button|Volume Up}} buttons. Then select ''Recovery'' pressing {{Button|Volume Up}} and confirm with {{Button|Volume Down}}.
* '''Fastboot:''' Do the same as for Recovery, but select the ''Fastboot'' option in the menu.
* '''MediaTek Preloader:''' The preloader triggers automatically everytime the phone turns on or reboots.

== Installation ==
Fastboot doesn't allow flashing on this phone.

pmOS can be installed either using a ''Recovery ZIP'' through '''TWRP''' or using MediaTek's '''SP Flash Tool'''.

=== Unlock the bootloader ===
# Enable Developer Mode in Android tapping 5 times the <code>Build Number</code> in <code>Settings -> About Phone</code>.
# Then go to <code>Settings -> Developer Options</code> and tap <code>OEM Unlock</code>.
=== Install using Recovery ZIP ===
Follow the [[Installation_from_recovery_mode|Installation from recovery mode]] guide.
=== Install using SP Flash Tool ===
# Export the pmOS files running <code>pmbootstrap install && pmbootstrap export</code>
# Open '''SP Flash Tool'''.
# Select the [https://pastebin.com/aUfY5kPk MT6753 scatter file].
# Asign <code>boot.img-vernee-k506</code> to partition '''boot''' and <code>vernee-k506.img</code> to partition '''system'''
# Click {{Button|Download}} and turn on/restart the phone. It will automatically flash the files.
