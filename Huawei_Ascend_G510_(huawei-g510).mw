== Additional info ==

=== Entering "Fastboot mode" ===

Hold the '''Volume Down''' button, and then press the '''Power''' button

=== Entering "Recovery mode" ===

Hold the '''Volume Up''' button, and then press the '''Power''' button

=== Obtaining the OEM unlock key ===

The Android version running on the device does not support unlocking OEM. A special key has to be retrieved from a [https://emui.huawei.com/en/unlock_detail form] on the manufacturers  website.

All necessary data can be found in the phones system information. Only the IMEI number seems to be wrong. Dump the displayed number into the search help on this [https://imei24.com/imei_check/Huawei/ site] and take the correct returend one instead.  

Finally unlock the connected device via:
