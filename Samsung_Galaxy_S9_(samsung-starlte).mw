== How to enter flash mode ==
Press and hold {{Button|Volume Down}} + {{Button|Bixby}} + {{Button|Power}} simultaneously. Then click {{Button|Volume Up}} to confirm.

== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->

== Notes ==
* The kernel panics in config_usb_cfg_link when booting.
* Using a prebuilt kernel still results in a panic.
* <del>It panics right after initializing the wlan, so it might be related to this.</del>
* Deleting wlan drivers still results in panic.
* I found a log file [https://pastebin.com/ztfFvzmf here] for a star2lte, so this could be related?.
