== What works ==
* USB networking
* Framebuffer graphics (Xorg/Wayland)

== Requires running Android services/using libhybris ==
* Wi-Fi (needs MediaTek's custom firmware loader)
* 3D acceleration (via libhybris and xf86-video-hwcomposer)
* Audio (via libhybris and pulseaudio-module-droid, possible to achieve with ALSA configs)

== What does not work ==
* Everything else not mentioned specifically

== Installation ==
The easiest way for now is to use the Flash Tool from [http://support.planetcom.co.uk/index.php/Flashing_Guide official flashing guide], replacing  linux.img in the firmware package with planet-geminipda.img and linux_boot.img with boot.img-planet-geminipda.

The device package also includes an initramfs hook, which will try to mount the userdata and linux partitions, looking for a /postmarketOS.img file (exported as planet-geminipda.img). This can be used for non-intrusive installation. That Image file needs to be expanded to the wanted size in advance, for example:

<code>% truncate -s 2G postmarketOS.img</code>
