== What works ==
* Display
* Weston

== What does not work ==
* Touchscreen
* USB (doesn't even show up in dmesg or lsusb with the current kernel options.)
* Networking (since USB doesn't work)

== How to enter flash mode ==
Press '''Power + Volume Up''' to enter download/odin mode.

== Installation ==
This has to be done in two parts:
* First create an android recovery image of PMOS and flash it using TWRP.
* Then use the usual heimdall flasher method to install the kernel and initramfs (flash_kernel).
Doing both with one method results in errors in both situations.
