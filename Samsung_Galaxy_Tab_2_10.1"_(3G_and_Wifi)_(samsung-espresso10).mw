== What works ==
* Display
* Weston
* Touchscreen
* USB
* Wifi (if started up manually, there's still some problems on boot)
* FDE w/ osk-sdl

== What does not work ==
* RIL (hasn't been setup yet, but Replicant got it going on the android side so it should be possible.)
* 2D + 3D acceleration (so most UIs slow down to a crawl, such as plasma-mobile.)

== To test/do ==
* Audio
* Graphics Acceleration
* GPS/Compass/Sensors
* RIL

== How to enter flash mode ==
Press '''Power + Volume Up''' to enter download/odin mode.

== Installation ==
This has to be done in two parts:
* First create an android recovery image of PMOS and flash it using TWRP.
* Then use the usual heimdall flasher method to install the kernel and initramfs (flash_kernel).
Doing both with one method results in errors in both situations.
