== Development Notes ==

===Radio===
* The Ouya uses a BCM4330 radio chip for wifi and bluetooth. Drivers for this chip is built into the linux mainline as of 3.3 and the kernel we use uses 3.1 with the driver support (presumably) backported. Otherwise, we can use the Android binaries (which would be non-free). 

* Two later releases (the completely white special edition and completely black 2nd generation) [https://www.s-config.com/cyanogen-mod-and-the-ouya/ allegedly use a BCM4334 chipset.] This needs to be implemented and tested at a future date.

===Kernel===
* Currently we avoid flashing directly to the device as  [https://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/5i02u4/ouya_dead_apx_mode/dcvlyts/ a corrupted kernel would irreversibly brick the Ouya due to the locked bootloader.] We use a tool called [https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2692836 Ouya BootMenu] [https://github.com/milaq/ouya_bootmenu (source)] that allows us to run the postmarketOS kernel through a kexec method. This implements an extra failsafe to prevent bricking and in theory allows dualbooting and kernel development.

===Other===
* Splash screen doesn't appear
* Hildon doesn't work?
* USB booting needs to be tested

== Installation ==
=== How to enter flash mode ===
# Connect Ouya to PC
# Use <code>adb reboot recovery</code> to enter recovery (or <code>adb reboot bootloader</code> to enter bootloader for fastboot commands)
===pmbootstrap===
{{todo| Work in progress, may be wrong. Only attempt for development}}

1. Flash [https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2295645 CWM] and [https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2692836 Ouya BootMenu] using fastboot.

2. Press and hold the power button on your Ouya until you scroll to bootloader, and then wait until the bootmenu disappears.

3. Run the following using pmbootstrap
<pre class="shell">
pmbootstrap init

pmbootstrap install --no-fde

pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs

pmbootstrap export
</pre>
{{note|DO NOT run flasher flash_kernel as it would overwrite bootmenu binary}}

4. Boot Ouya to recovery mode and using ADB, transfer the kernel file to your Ouya.
<pre class="shell">
# you need to push pmos boot.img to phone's /system/boot.img file
</pre>


5. Reboot your Ouya, postmarketOS should start automatically.
