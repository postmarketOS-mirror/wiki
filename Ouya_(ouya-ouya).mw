== Development Notes ==

===Radio===
* The Ouya uses a BCM4330 radio chip for wifi and bluetooth. The downstream and mainline kernel use the same wifi firmware. The firmware shipped with the device is the only known firmware to work with the Ouya. The BCM4330 firmware in <code>linux-firmware</code> does not work.  

* Two later releases (the completely white special edition and completely black 2nd generation) [https://www.s-config.com/cyanogen-mod-and-the-ouya/ allegedly use a BCM4334 chipset.] This needs to be implemented and tested at a future date.

===Kernel===
* Currently we avoid flashing directly to the device as  [https://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/5i02u4/ouya_dead_apx_mode/dcvlyts/ a corrupted kernel would irreversibly brick the Ouya due to the locked bootloader.] We use a tool called [https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2692836 Ouya BootMenu] [https://github.com/milaq/ouya_bootmenu (source)] that allows us to run the postmarketOS kernel through a kexec method. This implements an extra failsafe to prevent bricking and in theory allows dualbooting and kernel development.

===eMMC===
The eMMC storgate on mainline cannot run at 1.8V DDR mode even though it does on the downstream kernel. Attempting to run at this mode leads to data corruption. The device tree is configured to run the eMMC storage at 3.3V High Speed mode.

Despite this, the eMMC storage benchmarks the same on mainline as on the downstream kernel.
<source lang="shell">
$ hdparm -t /dev/mmcblk1

/dev/mmcblk1:
Timing buffered disk reads:  127 MB in 3.02 seconds = 43021 kB/s
</source>

===Display Resolution===
On the mainline kernel, display resolutions above 1280x720 are glitchy. The GPU is dependent on memory bandwidth but EMC scaling is not implemented in mainline. The Ouya bootloader sets the memory to 400 Mhz. Higher display resolutions work a bit better when the memory is set to 800Mhz but it is still glitchy.

===Other===
* Splash screen doesn't appear
* Hildon doesn't work?
* USB booting needs to be tested

== Installation ==
=== How to enter flash mode ===
1. Connect Ouya to PC

2. Use <code>adb reboot recovery</code> to enter recovery (or <code>adb reboot bootloader</code> to enter bootloader for fastboot commands)

===pmbootstrap===
{{todo| Work in progress, may be wrong. Only attempt for development}}

1. Flash [https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2295645 CWM] and [https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2692836 Ouya BootMenu].

2. Turn on Ouya, then press the power button many times until it scrolls to '''Bootloader''', and then wait until the boot menu disappears.

3. Run the following using ''pmbootstrap'':
<source>
# pmbootstrap init
# pmbootstrap install --no-fde
# pmbootstrap export
# pmbootstrap pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs
</source>
{{note|'''WARNING''': This will create two partitions under ''system'' partition instead of one which won't allow you to use '''Normal Boot''' option in Ouya BootMenu}}

4. Reboot Ouya, then press the power button many times until it scrolls to '''Recovery''', and then wait until CWM appears.

6. Using CWM menu options, mount ''/data'' partition.

7. Copy postmarketOS ''boot.img'' to ''/sdcard'' as ''altboot.img'':
<source>
# adb push /tmp/postmarketOS-export/boot.img-ouya-ouya /sdcard/altboot.img
</source>

8. Reboot Ouya, then press the power button many times until it scrolls to '''Alternate Boot''', and then wait until postmarketOS appears.
