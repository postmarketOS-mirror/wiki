== Development Notes ==
===Radio===
* The Ouya uses a BCM4330 radio chip for wifi and bluetooth. Drivers for this chip is built into the linux mainline as of 3.3. The Ouya kernel we use runs 3.x, but I could not get wifi working. This would be the last step after osk-sdl to making this port usable.

* Two later releases (the completely white special edition and completely black 2nd generation) [https://www.s-config.com/cyanogen-mod-and-the-ouya/ allegedly use a BCM4334 chipset.] This needs to be implemented and tested at a future date.

===Kernel===
* Currently we avoid flashing directly to the device as  [https://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/5i02u4/ouya_dead_apx_mode/dcvlyts/ a corrupted kernel would irreversibly brick the Ouya due to the locked bootloader.] We use a tool called [https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2692836 Ouya BootMenu] [https://github.com/milaq/ouya_bootmenu (source)] that allows us to run the postmarketOS kernel through a kexec method. This implements an extra failsafe to prevent bricking and in theory allows dualbooting and kernel development.

* Using Ouya Boot Menu, it may be possible to retain the original Ouya android ROM (or any Android ROM you choose to flash) while still being able to boot postmarketOS. This would require renaming the pmOS kernel image to <code>kernelA1.img</code> while having the device configuration to launch from external storage.

== Installation ==
=== How to enter flash mode ===
# Connect Ouya to PC
# Use <code>adb reboot recovery</code> to enter recovery (or <code>adb reboot bootloader</code> to enter bootloader for fastboot commands)
===pmbootstrap===
'''Work in progress. Only attempt for development.'''

# Flash [https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2295645 CWM] and [https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2692836 Ouya BootMenu] using fastboot.
# Follow the [[Porting to a new device]] guide to build the kernel and chroot using the [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/tree/device-ouya-ouya device-ouya-ouya branch of pmbootstrap]. Follow up to "flashing"
# Enter your Ouya into bootloader mode using the power button, a monitor, and Ouya BootMenu
# Follow the [[Inspecting the initramfs]] guide to add a debug shell and boot into pmOS
