The Moto G7 Play is a 5.7" phone with a 720 x 1512P display. It can be bought for about Â£120 in the UK. It is A/B partitioned, and has an arm64 cpu, however Custom ROMSs must be a64 binder (32 bit OS). No work has gone on to port this device to PostMarketOS yet.

There is an XDA thread for compiling the kernel, for use with android. This may become helpful. It can be found [https://forum.xda-developers.com/g7-play/development/wip-stock-kernel-compiled-source-t4066599 here] And source code for the kernel can be found [https://github.com/MotorolaMobilityLLC/kernel-msm/releases/tag/MMI-PPYS29.105-134-7 here]
