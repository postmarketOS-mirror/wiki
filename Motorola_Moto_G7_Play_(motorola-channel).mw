The Moto G7 Play is a 5.7" phone with a 720 x 1512P display. It can be bought for about Â£120 in the UK. It is A/B partitioned, and has an arm64 cpu, however Custom ROMSs must be a64 binder (32 bit OS). No work has gone on to port this device to PostMarketOS yet.

===Kernel===
There is an XDA thread, which hasnt been posted to for a while, for compiling the kernel, for use with android. This may become helpful. It can be found [https://forum.xda-developers.com/g7-play/development/wip-stock-kernel-compiled-source-t4066599 here] And source code for the kernel can be found [https://github.com/MotorolaMobilityLLC/kernel-msm/releases/tag/MMI-PPYS29.105-134-7 here]

I have had a look at trying to compile the kernel and there *is* a defconfig in the arm64 architcture, so i guess it may work, but i couldnt get it to build (hey, this is my first time compiling a linux kernel)

==Notes from Jean-Etienne==

The [https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_motorola_sdm632/ SDM32 kernel from LineageOS] builds fine with arm64 architecture. Apparently the bootloader passes a skip_initramfs option which needs to be disabled in the kernel for postmarketOS to boot.
