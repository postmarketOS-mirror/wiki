== Installation ==
The mainline kernel can only be booted through U-Boot, not directly with the Samsung bootloader. U-Boot is installed as intermediate bootloader on the boot partition, so it does not replace the Samsung bootloader entirely. pmbootstrap can only support one bootloader configuration at the moment, which is why U-Boot is also recommended when installing the downstream kernel.

Boot into Download Mode using <code>Power</code> + <code>Volume Down</code> + <code>Home</code> and follow the instructions at [[ST-Ericsson_NovaThor_U8500#U-Boot]] to install U-Boot.

Finally, just follow the [[Installation guide]].

== Mainline ==
'''Working:'''
* Display (partial - works but cannot be turned off properly)
* GPU (Mali 400 MP using Lima)
* Touchscreen
* WiFi
* Bluetooth (partial - at least on my device scanning for other devices works but it keeps disconnecting when connecting to other devices; not sure why)
* IMU (Accelerometer + Gyroscope)
* USB

'''Not working:'''
* Audio
* Camera
* ...

== Experience ==
'''Downstream:''' The best user interface to install is XFCE4. Other ones do lag, or just don't respond. Especially KDE Plasma.

'''Mainline:''' Plasma Mobile and Phosh should work okay.
