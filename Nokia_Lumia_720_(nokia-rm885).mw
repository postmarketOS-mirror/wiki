== Basic info ==

* [https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_lumia_720-5321.php More specs]
* [https://github.com/Android4Lumia/bootloader_msm8227 LittleKernel Bootloader]
* [https://github.com/Android4Lumia/android_kernel_nokia_msm8x27 Kernel source]

== Additional info ==
* Possible emmc corruption when flashing? From Android4Lumia page: <q>My phone has Samsung eMMC, can I still use this? You can, but be aware, that those eMMCs are more probable to die unexpectedly than Hynix or Toshiba ones.</q>. Files are randomly corrupted on my device as well.
* <s>Booting from SD card failed as the files there also seems to become corrupted.</s> 2GB Kingston seems to work without problems
* X crashes: <code>[   118.028] (EE) Segmentation fault at address 0x4</code>

== Unlocking / installing bootloader ==
Bootloader is unlocked with a proprietary windows application, [https://www.wpinternals.net/ WP Internals]. Windows Device Recovery Tool (thor2.exe) is also needed.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OW88UTTDug Here] is a video describing how to backup the phone, install littlekernel bootloader, and finally installing twrp recovery and lineageos.
The device can be flashed with normal fastboot application after this point.

== Key combinations with original bootloader ==

TBD

== Key combinations with littlekernel bootloader ==
* Recovery: volume up (phone needs to be repartitioned, and recovery must be flashed)
* Fastboot: volume down
* Mass Storage mode / QHSUSB_DLOAD: both volume buttons

== Installation ==
Setup chroot. Select nokia-rm885 as device.
<pre class="shell">./pmbootstrap.py init</pre>

Build rootfs
<pre class="shell">./pmbootstrap.py build device-nokia-rm885</pre>

Build kernel
<pre class="shell">./pmbootstrap.py build linux-nokia-rm885</pre>

Flash rootfs (Note, this will install rootfs to system partition. You can optionally try to install to userdata partition with --partition userdata argument. In that case you should probably erase system partition with "sudo fastboot erase system")
<pre class="shell">./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_rootfs</pre>

Flash kernel
<pre class="shell">./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_kernel</pre>

Run kernel (or you can just restart phone manually)
<pre class="shell">./pmbootstrap.py flasher boot</pre>


== Tips & tricks ==
* Depending on current mode the phone will not restart if the cable is plugged in. Unplug the usb cable and hold volume down + power for 30s. After that, release volume down and then power.
* Installing from recovery with sideload creates some kind of bootloop with blinking backlight.
