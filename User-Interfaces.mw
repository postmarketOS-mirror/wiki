At the moment [[Weston]] is the default UI for postmarketOS. It is simple and helps us to keep researching and developing the base of pmOS but in the future we will also support other more sophisticated and fancy User Interfaces.

Here is a list showing examples and the on-going work on this topic.

== User Interfaces ==

=== Weston ===

Project page: https://github.com/wayland-project/weston

Default minimal interface based on XWayland. It allows developers to do &quot;simple&quot; things like running firefox and opening a terminal, plus testing the touchscreen and other peripherals.

See '''[[Weston]]'''.
=== Plasma Mobile ===

Project page: https://plasma-mobile.org/

Based on KDE.

Work in Progress.

For more information, see '''[[Plasma Mobile]]''' and issues [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/161 #161], [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/378 #378].

=== Hildon ===

Hildon is an application framework originally developed for mobile devices (PDAs, mobile phones, etc.) running the Linux operating system as well as the Symbian operating system. It was developed by Nokia for the Maemo operating system and is now a part of GNOME. It focuses on providing a finger-friendly interface. It is primarily a set of GTK+ extensions that provide mobile-deviceâ€“oriented functionality, but also provides a desktop environment that includes a task navigator for opening and switching between programs, a control panel for user settings, and status bar, task bar and home applets. It is standard on the Maemo platform used by the Nokia Internet Tablets and the [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/wiki/nokia-rx51-%28Nokia-N900%29 Nokia N900] smartphone.

Hildon is based on GTK2 and there is a work in progress port to GTK3.

For more information, see '''[[Hildon]]''' and PR [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/461 #461].
===MATE===
Desktop environment forked from the now-unmaintained code base of GNOME 2. See '''[[MATE]]'''.
=== Others ===

See issue [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/62 #62] for more information on other UIs that could be ported to postmarketOS. Some of these are:

* '''[[LuneOS]]''' ([https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/629 link]) (UI from continuation of webOS, HP's discontinued and open sourced mobile operating system with Wayland and QT5)
* PDA interfaces, such as Open Palmtop Integrated Environment and GPE Palmtop Environment may be viable. Both suited to devices capable of stylus input, such as the Nokia N900 and Galaxy Note devices.

*''[https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Category:Desktop Other graphical interfaces supported by Alpine]'' should work to some extent on pmOS.  These include GNOME3.
