== What works ==
* Boot process
* Telnet/SSH over USB
* Screen
* Weston
* USB keyboard
* Touchscreen
* Flashing in odin mode

== What does not work ==
* WiFi
* Bluetooth
* Xorg (FBDEV(0): FBIOBLANK: Resource busy (Screen blanking not supported by kernel - disabling))
* fde or osk-sdl (creates bootloop)
* Flashing rootfs through fastboot (but works with heimdall)

== How to enter flash mode ==
* Connect a USB cable
* Power the device off
* Hold power + volume up
* You should get a bootloader screen saying "Downloading... Do not turn off target !!"

== Installation ==
When installing, I found it easiest to sideload a ZIP via ClockworkMod Recovery.
# Build a suitable postmarketOS recovery image:<source lang="shell">
$ ./pmbootstrap.py init # samsung-manta
$ ./pmbootstrap.py install --no-fde --android-recovery-zip</source>
# Boot the device in to recovery, by toggling to "RECOVERY MODE" using the volume rocker.
# Select "INSTALL ZIP" and then "SIDELOAD ZIP FROM ADB"
# Run the standard sideload command from pmbootstrap:<source lang="shell">
./pmbootstrap.py flasher --method adb sideload</source>
The device will take roughly 60 seconds to boot to the Weston environment.
