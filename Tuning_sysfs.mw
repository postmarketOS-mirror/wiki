After porting postmarketOS to your device, you might find that still some features don't work. You may need to adjust some values inside the /sys directory.

sysfs is a pseudo file system provided by the Linux kernel that exports information about various kernel subsystems, hardware devices, and associated device drivers from the kernel's device model to user space through virtual files. In addition to providing information about various devices and kernel subsystems, exported virtual files are also used for their configuring.

==diff method==
One approach is comparing the contents of these files when TWRP or LineageOS is running and the same for pmOS.

The following script dumps the content of /sys/devices. Copy it as <code>dumpsys.sh</code>

<pre class="shell">#!/bin/sh
# dumpsys.sh
DIR=&quot;/sys/devices&quot;

walk() {
    for file in $(ls $1); do
        path=&quot;$1/$file&quot;
        if test -L &quot;$path&quot;; then
            continue
        fi
        if test -f &quot;$path&quot;; then
            echo &quot;$path&quot;
            cat &quot;$path&quot;
        fi
        if test -d &quot;$path&quot;; then
            walk &quot;$path&quot;
        fi
    done
}

others() {
    cat /proc/cpuinfo
    cat /proc/cmdline
}

walk &quot;$DIR&quot;
others</pre>
Upload it to your device when running TWRP (use <code>adb push</code>) and when running postmarketOS (use <code>scp</code>). Run it and then compare the output.

For TWRP/LineageOS:

<pre class="shell">adb push dumpsys.sh /
adb shell &quot;sh /dumpsys.sh &gt; /devices-twrp.dump&quot;
adb pull /devices-twrp.dump .</pre>
For pmOS:

<pre class="shell">scp dumpsys.sh user@172.16.42.1:~
# sh dumpsys.sh &gt; devices-pmos.dump
scp user@172.16.42.1:~/devices-pmos.dump .</pre>
Then get the differences ([https://gist.github.com/yuvadm/654f2c5e578d0e26cec3ea28b5c24b30 example]):

<pre class="shell">diff -u devices-pmos.dump devices-twrp.dump &gt; devices.diff</pre>
You could also run it in even in the stock ROM but it is important that you run the same kernel version in postmarketOS then.

====Script hanging====
On some devices (like Xperia Z) this script will hang on <code>vsync_event</code> files. To continue the script to the next file we just kill the process that processes the <code>vsync_event</code> file:

<pre class="shell">ps w | grep vsync_event # To find process id of the cat command that was processing vsync_event
kill -SIGTERM <pid> # Kill the process</pre>

====Script reboots system====
On some devices (like Xperia Z1) this script can reboot the device when executed in TWRP. To fix this, you need to find out which file is causing the reboot and skip it. You can find the file by running the script without output redirection (it should be the last line printed before the reboot - see example below).
<pre class="shell">$ adb shell "sh /dumpsys.sh"
/sys/devices/0.qcom,msm-cpufreq/modalias
platform:0.qcom,msm-cpufreq
...
/sys/devices/mdss_dsi_panel/interval_array         -----> THE FILE THAT CAUSES A REBOOT
------> THE DEVICE REBOOTS</pre> 
Now that you found the file, you can exclude it by updating the script. Change this part:
<pre class="shell">if test -f &quot;$path&quot;; then
     echo &quot;$path&quot;
     cat &quot;$path&quot;
fi</pre>
To this:
<pre class="shell">if test -f "$path"; then
    if [ "$path" = "/sys/devices/mdss_dsi_panel/interval_array" ]
    then
        continue
    fi
    echo "$path"
    cat "$path"
fi</pre>
If there are two or more entries to skip, combine them with a logical OR (||) like this:
<pre class="shell">if test -f "$path"; then
    if [ "$path" = "/sys/devices/mdss_dsi_panel/interval_array" ] ||
       [ "$path" = "/sys/devices/iio:device0/self_test_run" ] ||
       [ "$path" = "/sys/devices/iio:device1/self_test_run" ]
    then
        continue
    fi
    echo "$path"
    cat "$path"
fi</pre>

==Applying tuning==

To make changes to the device, create "initfs-hook.sh" in the device folder and add "initfs-hook.sh" to the source list.

The initfs-hook.sh runs commands before booting.  Look at the examples section to see how the file should be used.

== Examples ==

=== i9070 port ===

This way, user <code>drebrez</code> figured out two values needed for the framebuffer configuration for the i9070 port.

<pre class="shell">echo 16 &gt; /sys/devices/platform/mcde_fb/graphics/fb0/bits_per_pixel
echo 960,1600 &gt; /sys/devices/platform/mcde_fb/graphics/fb0/virtual_size</pre>
