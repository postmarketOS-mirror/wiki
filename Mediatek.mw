= Booting procedure =
== Power applied to the SoC ==
When chip is powered on the dram controller pushes the address of brom (boot rom, mask rom that is hardwired) to PC (program counter) and execution of rom begins.

== Brom execution ==
# UART1 gets initialized to some predetermined baudrate. Baud usually depends in chip input clock source. Observation has been made that UART1 is disabled on many phones, but can be enabled if proper firmware is used and eFuses are not blown.
# Initialize storage with low clock. Reason why it's using low clock is because muxes are not programmed at this stage.
# Wait for "Start" string on UART1 for unknown amount of time, the internet keeps buzzing about 150ms. After start is recieved, listen to commands from host until jump is observed (refer to brom spec in further reading section). If start is not sent then Preloader image will be loaded from the storage to the SRAM (static ram) and brom loads it. Not sure if flags SP flash tool needs are used at bootup phase.
# If KCOL0 pin is shorted to the ground, preloader loading is avoided and download protocol is rolled up on USB port.

== Memory maps of different system on chips ==

== Image format ==
{{note|Incomplete and has missing information. Feel free to coordinate corrections on Matrix chat. Information here is only for reference. Flashing the binaries to storage will be done using brom protocol and custom flashing software.}}

This format is used in brom and preloader(has to be verified) while flashing with SP flash tool. All fields are in little endian.
