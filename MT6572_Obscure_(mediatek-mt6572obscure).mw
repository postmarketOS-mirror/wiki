== Why this? ==
This phone is an unknown manufacturer Samsung S4 Mini clone produced in 2014. I got scammed while buying this counterfeit product but hey hackers (or wannabes like me) still can see an opportunity in this thing right? It's very low end phone with 256MB ram with 512MB nand storage. This project is a learning experience for me and don't expect a working thing soon.
