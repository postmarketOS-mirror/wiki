== Initial comments ==

Note that there are different models of the Samsung Galaxy J3, I had the J320FN which has codename samsung-j3nxlte. To see which one you have,
if you still have the original recovery image on your device, power it off and then hold down the home buttom, power button and volume up button.
See at the top of the phone's screen for the model code. If it's J320FN(string of characters) you're probably good to go. Otherwise, I'd recommend seeing the resources I've
linked below such as the XDA developers thread. If yours is J320F it will probably be very similar to port.

== How to enter flash mode ==

This is not used for flashing postmarketOS, but is used for flashing recovery partition with TWRP. See {{issue|1834|pmbootstrap}} for details on why I do not recommend flashing postmarketOS with Heimdall.

Hold down home button, power button and volume down button for a number of seconds. Then once a
prompt appears on screen, press volume up. You are now in download mode (it will say so on the screen).

== Installation ==

Firstly, download the [https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-j3-2016/development/rom-lineageos-14-1-samsung-galaxy-j3-t3667015 TWRP] from the XDA
developers page for the unofficial Lineage OS port. The download is in the section labelled "Download".

Use heimdall to flash <code>recovery.img</code> to the recovery partition of your device:
* Put it in download mode (see above)
* Connect to computer
* Run <code>heimdall detect</code> to see if heimdall can see it.
* Run <code>heimdall flash --RECOVERY recovery.img</code>, making sure you are in the directory with <code>recovery.img</code>

Now see the [[Installation_guide|installation guide]] for details. Flashing via heimdall did not work for me, so
instead follow the [[Android_Recovery_Zip_Installation|Android Recovery Zip installation guide]] instructions:

Run 

<code>pmbootstrap install --android-recovery-zip</code>

to install to android recovery zip.

Boot your phone into recovery mode: power off and hold down volume up, power and home buttons. You should see the "Team Win" logo.
Select "Advanced" then "ADB Sideload". Connect your phone to your PC. Swipe to start the flash. Next run

<code>pmbootstrap flasher --method=adb sideload</code>

on your PC and watch as the postmarketOS ascii appears. Select reboot, and your display and touchscreen should work out of the box.

== Personal recommendation ==

I recommend disconnecting the cable when you turn the device off. My device freezes on the charging splash screen if I don't take it out.
This requires me to remove the battery to fix. In fact, I try to avoid having the battery inserted at the same time as the charging cable,
excluding when the device is running postmarketOS.

I don't know if you'll have this problem.
