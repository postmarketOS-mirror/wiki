There are closed source components (like firmware and bootloaders) in every phone, and [https://ollieparanoid.github.io/post/security-warning/ they are dangerous]. It seems next to impossible to replace them with open source components, and it won't be feasible any time soon for postmarketOS. Yet, this is an interesting topic, so this page provides links for deeper insight into the topic.

CoolReaper can perform the following tasks:

* Download, install, or activate any Android application without user consent or notification
* Clear user data, uninstall existing applications, or disable system applications
* Notify users of a fake over-the-air (OTA) update that doesnâ€™t update the device, but installs unwanted applications
* Send or insert arbitrary SMS or MMS messages into the phone.
* Dial arbitrary phone numbers
* Upload information about device, its location, application usage, calling and SMS history to a Coolpad server
