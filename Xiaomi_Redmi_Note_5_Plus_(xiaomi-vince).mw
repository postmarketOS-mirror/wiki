== How to enter flash mode ==
# Turn off the device
# Press Power+Volume Down to enter fastboot

== Installation ==

Here's how to boot pmOS via fastboot:

# Install to a SD card with 
<code>$ pmbootstrap install --sdcard=/dev/sdX</code>
# Insert the SD card into the device
# Connect the device to your PC
# Enter the fastboot mode
# Finally, boot pmOS: 
<code>$ pmbootstrap flasher boot</code>

or 
# Enter the fastboot mode
# Flash system 
<code>$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_system</code>
# Flash kernel 
<code>$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</code>
# Finally, reboot into pmOS: 
<code>$ fastboot reboot</code>

== Audio ==
To enable audio you need to install triggerhappy.
You can do it in many ways:

# At the first 
<code>$ pmbootstrap install</code> command appending 
<code> --add triggerhappy</code> 
or with
<code>$ sudo apk add triggerhappy</code>
on a running device

# On both cases you always need to enable the triggerhappy daemon with:

<code>$ sudo rc-update add triggerhappy default</code>
