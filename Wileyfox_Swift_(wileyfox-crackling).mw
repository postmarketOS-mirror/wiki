Fairly popular device based on reference Qualcomm design. Initialy shipped with CyanogenOS.  
There is also another device called GeneralMobile 4g (Android One device) that is very similar with this one.

== Users owning this device ==
{{Device owners}}

== How to enter flash mode ==
* '''Recovery:''' Power on the device with both <code>Power</code> and <code>Volume Down</code> buttons.
* '''Stock fastboot:''' Power on the device with both <code>Power</code> and <code>Volume Up</code> buttons. You only need this to install lk2nd.
* '''lk2nd Fastboot:''' Power on the device. After it vibrates/the display shows up, hold <code>Volume Down</code>.
{{note|'''Note:''' Pressing the keys too early will cause the stock bootloader to handle the key combination. You will end up in the wrong Fastboot interface.}}


== Installation ==
# Install [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd lk2nd] (alternative bootloader that handles certain mainline quirks like setting up the WiFi/BT MAC addresses. Keep in mind that you have to install pmOS components with lk2nd, not original fastboot)
# Just follow the [[Installation guide]].

== Charging ==
Mainline kernel doesn't have proper charger driver yet. This means that only way to charge the device is to boot downstream kernel. Easiest way to do so is to boot to recovery (At least TWRP known to charge the device properly)
To give you at least some information, kernel that this device uses at the moment have simple driver that shows estimated capacity. (with error of roughly 10%) 
{{note|'''Note:''' Since driver can't measure capacity precisely, shown percentage will directly depend on current that your device consumes (e.g. it will show less if you will increase brightness.)}}

== Audio ==
See [[Qualcomm_Snapdragon_410_(MSM8916)#Audio]].

== Modem ==
See [[Qualcomm_Snapdragon_410_(MSM8916)#Modem]].

== USB Host (OTG) ==
This device doesn't support OTG so it can't provide power or even detect normal OTG adapters but it is still possible to use USB in host mode. This requires custom adapter that will provide power to your USB device. In order to detect such adapter we abuse the fact that USB ID pin in microUSB is used to force EDL mode but since it is pulled down we can't detect normal OTG adapters with it. (USB_ID on those adapters is connected to ground when we can only detect 5v on this pin) So your custom adapter not only should provide external power but also should provide logical-high signal to USB_ID. This can make such adapter dangerous for other devices so you should avoid plugging it anywhere else. You can put a resistor between 5v and USB ID to make it a bit safer. Please note that device will boot into EDL mode if you leave such adapter in while powering on the device. EDL have no visible indication and you will need to pull battery out in order to reboot.
