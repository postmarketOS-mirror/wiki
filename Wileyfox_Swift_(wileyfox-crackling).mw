Fairly popular device based on reference Qualcomm design. Initialy shipped with CyanogenOS.  
There is also another device called GeneralMobile 4g (Android One device) that is very similar with this one.

== Users owning this device ==
{{Device owners}}

== How to enter flash mode ==
* '''Recovery:''' Power on the device with both <code>Power</code> and <code>Volume Down</code> buttons.
* '''Stock fastboot:''' Power on the device with both <code>Power</code> and <code>Volume Up</code> buttons. You only need this to install lk2nd.
* '''lk2nd Fastboot:''' Power on the device. After it vibrates/the display shows up, hold <code>Volume Down</code>.
{{note|'''Note:''' Pressing the keys too early will cause the stock bootloader to handle the key combination. You will end up in the wrong Fastboot interface.}}


== Installation ==
# Install [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd lk2nd] (alternative bootloader that handles certain mainline quirks like setting up the WiFi/BT MAC addresses)
# Just follow the [[Installation guide]].


== Charging ==
Mainline kernel doesn't have proper charger driver yet. This means that only way to charge the device is to boot downstream kernel. Easiest way to do so is to boot to recovery (At least TWRP known to charge the device properly)
To give you at least some information, kernel that this device uses at the moment have simple driver that shows estimated capacity. (with error of roughly 10%) 
{{note|'''Note:''' Since driver can't measure capacity precisely, shown percentage will directly depend on current that your device consumes (e.g. it will show less if you will increase brightness.)}}

== Audio ==
<!-- TODO: Share this between all MSM8916 devices -->
Everything is muted by default and must be enabled through alsaucm. Unfortunately, the tool is not very user-friendly.

 $ alsaucm -i -c msm8916
 set _verb HiFi
 set _enadev <device>

where <code><device></code> is one of <code>Speaker</code>, <code>Earpiece</code>, <code>Headphones</code>, <code>PrimaryMic</code>, <code>HeadsetMic</code> or <code>SecondaryMic</code>.
alsaucm does not track which devices are already enabled, therefore it is possible to produce combinations that won't work properly (e.g. <code>Headphones</code>+<code>Earpiece</code>). To switch between devices, the old device first needs to be re-enabled and then disabled:

 $ alsaucm -i -c msm8916
 set _verb HiFi
 set _enadev OLD
 set _disdev OLD
 set _enadev NEW

{{note|'''Warning:''' alsaucm sets the volume to maximum by default. It is possible to increase the volume even further, however, this may lead to permanent damage to your speaker!}}
