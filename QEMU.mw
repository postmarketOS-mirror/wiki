QEMU allows running postmarketOS in virtual machines. The following architectures are available:

* [[QEMU_amd64_(qemu-amd64)|QEMU for x86_64]]
* [[QEMU_aarch64_(qemu-aarch64)|QEMU for aarch64]]

Note that running a virtual machine for a foreign architecture (e.g. aarch64 on x86_64) requires CPU emulation which is rather slow. Prefer the native architecture when possible.

=== Phosh ===
By default, Phosh has the resolution hard-coded to 720x1440 (like the Librem 5), so the display is cut off on usual 1920x1080 (Full HD) monitors.

You can change the resolution by editing <code>/usr/share/phosh/phoc.ini</code>. By default it contains:

 [output:Virtual-1]
 # For the x86 VM using QXL to get a phone like geometry
 modeline = 87.25  720 776 848 976  1440 1443 1453 1493 -hsync +vsync
 mode = 720x1440
 scale = 2

To add a new resolution, you need to add a new <code>modeline</code>, then change the <code>mode</code> (and eventually the <code>scale</code>). You can generate the modelines using the <code>cvt</code> tool.

For example, to set the resolution to qHD (540x960):

 $ cvt -v 540 960
 Warning: Aspect Ratio is not CVT standard.
 # 544x960 59.96 Hz (CVT) hsync: 59.72 kHz; pclk: 43.00 MHz
 Modeline "544x960_60.00"   43.00  544 576 632 720  960 963 973 996 -hsync +vsync

Note how it changed the horizontal resolution to <code>544</code> to match the CVT standard (weird). Then add the new <code>modeline</code> and change <code>mode</code>:

 [output:Virtual-1]
 # For the x86 VM using QXL to get a phone like geometry
 modeline = 87.25  720 776 848 976  1440 1443 1453 1493 -hsync +vsync
 modeline = 43.00  544 576 632 720  960 963 973 996 -hsync +vsync
 mode = 544x960
 # Maybe it's a bit too large with scale 2 on this resolution? Or maybe not, just test it out :)
 scale = 1

Restart QEMU or <code>rc-service lightdm restart</code>, then Phosh should show up with the new resolution. Note that the <code>modeline</code> is necessary to support custom resolutions, you cannot just set the <code>mode</code>.
