QEMU allows running postmarketOS in virtual machines. The following architectures are available:

* [[QEMU_amd64_(qemu-amd64)|QEMU for x86_64]]
* [[QEMU_aarch64_(qemu-aarch64)|QEMU for aarch64]]

Note that running a virtual machine for a foreign architecture (e.g. aarch64 on x86_64) requires CPU emulation which is rather slow. Prefer the native architecture when possible.
