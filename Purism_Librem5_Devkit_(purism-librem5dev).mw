== How to enter flash mode ==

The devkit has a switch on the same side as the reboot button, wifi switch, camera switch, and modem switch. Move it to the "USB Mode" position and hit the reboot button next to it in order to put the device into 'flash' mode.

== Installation ==

=== Flashing ===

pmbootstrap now has support for flashing the devkit with the <code>flasher</code> command. After running <code>pmbootstrap install</code> to generate a rootfs, the devkit can be flashed by putting it into 'USB mode' and executing <code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs</code>

Once the image has been flashed, place the device into emmc mode and hit the reboot button to start booting postmarketOS. The first boot can take a few minutes as it resizes the rootfs to fill all available space on the emmc disk.

=== Graphics ===

The Vivante GPU in the devkit is not fully currently supported upstream in Mesa. In order to achieve preliminary 3D acceleration on this device, the <code>mesa-purism-gc7000</code> package is used. This is automatically installed by pmbootstrap.

== Todo ==

* Bring up cellular modem
* Resolve issues with Wifi
** Interface shows up in OS, and wpa_supplicant seems to connect(?), but no IP.
* Resolve issues with Bluetooth
** Bluetooth can be started by loading the rsi_91x module with <code>dev_oper_mode=14</code> but this disables Wifi station/client mode and enables Wifi AP mode. It doesn't seem to work with <code>dev_oper_mode=13</code>, which enables Wifi client mode. 
* Test/enable camera
* Test/enable ambient light sensor
