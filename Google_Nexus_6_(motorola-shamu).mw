== What works ==

* USB networking
* Flashing
* Touch
* Screen
** Requires msm-fb-refresher to update the framebuffer.
** The brightness can be adjusted by writing a value from 0 to 255 to <code>/sys/devices/fd900000.qcom,mdss_mdp/qcom,mdss_fb_primary.164/leds/lcd-backlight/brightness</code>.
* LEDs
** The green charging LED can be set by writing a value from 0 to 40 to <code>/sys/devices/leds-qpnp-10/leds/charging/brightness</code>.
** General purpose LEDs can be set by writing a value from 0 to 20 to the devices below, although there is no observable difference in brightness from 1 to 20.
*** Red: <code>/sys/devices/leds-qpnp-11/leds/red/brightness</code>
*** Green: <code>/sys/devices/leds-qpnp-12/leds/green/brightness</code>
*** Blue: <code>/sys/devices/leds-qpnp-13/leds/blue/brightness</code>

== What does not work ==

* Wi-Fi
** A <code>wlan0</code> interface is present, but it will not connect. It probably just needs firmware.

== How to enter flash mode ==

With the device powered off, hold Volume Down while booting.
