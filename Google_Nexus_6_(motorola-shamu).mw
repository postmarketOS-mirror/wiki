== What works ==

* USB networking
* Flashing
* Screen (The display only works if the framebuffer is refreshed manually or if msm-fb-refresher is started after the device has finished booting. If msm-fb-refresher starts at boot, the postmarket splash is replaced by a black screen and further refreshing does nothing.)

== What does not work ==

* Touch
** No devices at <code>/dev/input/eventX</code> respond to touch input.
** Has an Atmel maXTouch device at <code>/sys/devices/f9966000.i2c/i2c-1/1-004a</code> mapped to <code>/dev/input/event0</code>
* Wi-Fi (The interface is present, but it will not connect. It probably just needs firmware.)

== How to enter flash mode ==

With the device powered off, hold Volume Down while booting.
