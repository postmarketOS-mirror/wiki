== What works ==

* USB networking
* Flashing
* Screen (The display only works if the framebuffer is refreshed manually or if msm-fb-refresher is started after the device has finished booting. If msm-fb-refresher starts at boot, the postmarket splash is replaced by a black screen and further refreshing does nothing.)

== What does not work ==

* Touch
* Wi-Fi (It probably just needs firmware.)

== How to enter flash mode ==

With the device powered off, hold Volume Down while booting.
