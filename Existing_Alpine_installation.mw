To turn Alpine into postmarketOS:

* Install Alpine Linux
* Add [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/master/keys/pmos-5a03a13a.rsa.pub this key] to <code>/etc/apk/keys</code>
* Add this mirror to the top of <code>/etc/apk/repositories</code>:
 
<pre>http://postmarketos.brixit.nl</pre>
 
* Install the packages for the device and UI you want to have, for example:
 
<pre>apk add -u postmarketos-base device-nokia-rx51 postmarketos-ui-hildon</pre>
 
(Use <code>device-qemu-amd64</code> for a x86_64 installation, but this will also install a kernel -- maybe it makes sense to introduce a new "docker device" without any kernel, you could experiment with that if you want.)

If you want to use the postmarketOS initramfs, make sure that you adjust the [[Partition-layout|partition labels]] accordingly.
