To turn Alpine into postmarketOS:

* Install Alpine Linux
* Add [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/raw/master/pmb/data/keys/build.postmarketos.org.rsa.pub this key] as a file called "build.postmarketos.org.rsa.pub" into <code>/etc/apk/keys</code>
* Add this mirror to the top of <code>/etc/apk/repositories</code>:
 
<pre>http://postmarketos.brixit.nl/postmarketos/master</pre>

* Use your device package kernel for your device: (skip this if installing onto a desktop\laptop computer)

<pre>apk add -u postmarketos-base device-nokia-rx51</pre>

* Install the packages for the UI you want, for example:
 
<pre>apk add -u postmarketos-ui-xfce</pre> or
<pre>apk add -u postmarketos-ui-weston</pre>
 
(Use <code>device-qemu-amd64</code> for a x86_64 virtual machine installation, but this will also install a kernel -- maybe it makes sense to introduce a new "docker device" without any kernel, you could experiment with that if you want.)

If you want to use the postmarketOS initramfs, make sure that you adjust the [[Partition-layout|partition labels]] accordingly.
