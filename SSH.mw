This article provides an overview of how to use the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell SSH server] after postmarketOS was installed. It is aimed at beginners, who have possibly installed postmarketOS for the first time through the [[on-device installer]] or [[pmbootstrap]].

=== First login ===

Connect your phone via USB to your PC, then type:

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ ssh username@172.16.42.1
</syntaxhighlight>

Replace <code>username</code> with the username you chose in the installer. If your phone is in the same network as your PC (e.g. via Wi-Fi), you can replace the IP with the Wi-Fi IP and it should work as well.

If you have trouble connecting, see [[USB Network]] for a more detailed guide and for troubleshooting instructions.

=== Replace password with SSH key ===

If the SSH server is enabled in postmarketOS (in the on-device installer, one can decide at install-time), it listens to USB networking, Wi-Fi and cellular network. This provides a big attack surface, so it's highly recommended to install an SSH key and disable password login.
