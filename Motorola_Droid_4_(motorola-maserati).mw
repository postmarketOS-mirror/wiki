== Rooting ==

The Droid 4 doesn't have an unlockable bootloader, so rooting the device requires an exploit.

The easiest exploit is called "Saferoot", which was originally intended for Samsung devices, but also works for many others, including the Droid 4. You can find a saferoot .zip file in this XDA-Developers thread:

[https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2565758 https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2565758]

Download '''saferoot.zip''', extract it somewhere, then enable USB debugging on the Droid 4 and connect it to your computer. With it connected, open a command line, cd to where you extracted the files, then run '''install.sh''' if you're on a Linux machine, or '''install.bat''' if you're on a Windows machine.

Following the on-screen instructions, you should eventually have a rooted device!

== Custom Recovery: Safestrap ==

While there's no official version of TWRP for the '''maserati''', there is a custom recovery based on early versions: SafeStrap! 

'''YOU MUST ROOT AS LISTED ABOVE, FIRST!'''

You can download that here (make sure to get the one with '''maserati''' in the name!):

[http://droid.cs.fau.de/Safestrap/ Download Safestrap]

It's an APK file, so enable untrusted sources on your Droid 4 and install it. Once installed, if you're properly rooted, launching it should give you three options: Install recovery, uninstall recovery, and reboot to recovery.

Tapping "install recovery" should install the SafeStrap recovery! If it's successful, tapping "Reboot to recovery" should take you to the custom SafeStrap recovery.


=== Additional Info ===

Safestrap recovery has support for what it calls "ROM slots." At the time of this writing, you must select a non-stock slot in order to flash anything besides Android. 

To repeat: '''DO NOT TRY TO INSTALL pmOS TO THE STOCK SLOT! IT COULD BRICK YOUR DEVICE!'''.
