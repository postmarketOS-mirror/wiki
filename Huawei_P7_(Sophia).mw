== How to enter flash mode ==
Keep Power+Volume down pressed for about 5 seconds on boot

== Installation ==

Kernel doesn't build using my current configuration. All I get is this, without any meaningful error message:

 <nowiki>  LD      arch/arm/mach-hi6620/iomux/built-in.o
  LD      arch/arm/mach-hi6620/built-in.o
>>> ERROR: linux-huawei-sophia: build failed</nowiki>

<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->
