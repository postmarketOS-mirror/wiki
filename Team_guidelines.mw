=== Rules for merging ===

1. Each merge request needs two approvals from other core team members, unless they are super trivial or a critical fix that must be deployed immediately.

2. Use [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/mrhlpr mrhlpr], so we have the MR ID in the commit message

3. If possible, try to also review other people's MRs, and merge their stuff after giving them a second approval.
