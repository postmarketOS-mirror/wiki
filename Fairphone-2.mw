=== Current Boot Process ===

This is what I did:<br />
Use the efidroid lk.img (have to compile yourself right now) for working around an fastboot/lk issue in the stock Fairphone bootloader.

<pre>fastboot boot lk.img
fastboot flash system pmOS_system.img</pre>
Booting the boot.img doesn't work currently because of dt problems. Probably a similar issue as on the [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/wiki/Mozilla-Flame#current-boot-process Mozilla Flame].

pmOS branch: https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/tree/device-fairphone-fp2<br />
z3ntu's branch (maybe more up-to-date): https://github.com/z3ntu/pmbootstrap

== Abbreviations ==

'''lk''' = Little Kernel (that's what the bootloader which includes fastboot is based on for most newer devices)

'''dt''' = Device Tree (method of describing hardware, see https://www.devicetree.org/)
