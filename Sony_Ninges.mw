== Introduction ==

Ninges (or Ningles as some might argue) is a name commonly used by Sony fans (there are at least 7 of us!) to refer to Xperia Nile and Ganges platforms (sdm630/636, Xperia XA2 and 10 series).

The devices are mostly the same under the hood with the biggest outstander being the 10 Plus (mermaid), as it features a slightly different SoC (sdm636).

== Mainline ==

These devices are all running a shared out-of-tree-but-mainline kernel and thus have more or less same features working.

The goal is to achieve feature parity with PinePhone, or perhaps surpass it (these devices have some fancy-schmancy qcom features).


Currently the kernel is stored at [https://github.com/konradybcio/linux/commits/ninges_labs this link], but it's force-pushed quite often.
