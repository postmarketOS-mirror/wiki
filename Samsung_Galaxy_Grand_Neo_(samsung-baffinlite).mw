== How to enter flash mode ==
* Recovery: Power+VolUp
* Download/Odin: Power+VolDown+Home

== Installing ==

Follow the [[Installation guide]]. To flash to the device, boot into Download/Odin mode by holding the Volume Down + Home buttons while powering on the device, then run the <code>pmbootstrap flasher</code> commands to flash.

== Notes ==
The device freezes under heavy load (such as installing certain apps through apk).

Audio works for a split second and then crashes.

== Mainline status ==

There's mainlining work being done for this device by [[User:knuxfanwin8|knuxify]], however it currently does not boot. (See [https://github.com/knuxdroid/baffinlite-mainline the WIP mainline kernel repository] and [[User:knuxfanwin8/Grand Neo mainline journal]].)

|-
|USB
|[[User:knuxfanwin8/FSA9485|FSA9485]]
|Similar to the FSA9480, which is in mainline. The only difference seems to be the addition of support for some old Samsung docks.
|-
|Touchscreen
|MELFAS MMS144
|[[Google_Galaxy_Nexus_GSM_(samsung-maguro)]] claims that there's a driver in mainline for this touchscreen, but links to the mms114 driver instead.
|-
|WiFi, Bluetooth
|BCM4330
|Driver in mainline
|-
|Display
|HX8369, SC7798
|HX8369 is in mainline, SC7798 is not in mainline. Unclear which one is used, but upon analyzing drivers it seems like the HX8369 is more likely to be the display that's actually used.
|-
|Camera
|Samsung S5K4ECGX and ??? db8v61m
|s5k4ecgx is in mainline, db8v61m is only in Broadcom downstream. (TODO: Which one is the front-facing camera and which one is the main one?)
|-
|PMU
|BCM59xxx
|...?????

|Backlight?
|KTD3102
|Not in mainline.
