== How to enter flash mode ==
Recovery: Power+VolUp
Download/Odin: Power+VolDown

== Installation ==
Install to sdcard. The system partition doesn't flash due to bootloader limitations.

== Notes ==
The device freezes under heavy load (such as installing certain apps through apk).

Audio works for a split second and then crashes. Seems like it has something to do with some kind of clock.

== Mainline ==
There's a DTB for the chipset used in this phone in the mainline kernel, so mainlining could be possible.
