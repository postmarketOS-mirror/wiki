== How to enter flash mode ==
Recovery: Power+VolUp
Download/Odin: Power+VolDown

== Installation ==
Install to sdcard. The system partition doesn't flash due to bootloader limitations.

== Notes ==
WiFi uses BCM4330(b1). Oddly enough, the defconfig defines firmware paths that don't exist on the actual stock system; further testing will be required to figure out the proper firmware files, paths and versions.

USB seems to be quite buggy; if it's plugged in before the pmOS logo appears, the device refuses to boot; <strike>if it is plugged in after the pmOS logo, it will work for about a minute, then freeze the connection and then freeze the entire device.</strike> Only happens during apk add. Might be related to memory issues? Further logs will be required.

== Mainline ==

There's a DTB for the chipset used in this phone in the mainline kernel, so mainlining could be possible.
