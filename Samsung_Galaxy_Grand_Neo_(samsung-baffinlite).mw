== How to enter flash mode ==
Recovery: Power+VolUp
Download/Odin: Power+VolDown

== Installation ==
Install to sdcard. The system partition doesn't flash due to bootloader limitations.

== Notes ==
The device freezes under heavy load (such as installing certain apps through apk).

Audio works for a split second and then crashes.

|FSA9485
|There's a fsa9480 driver which is pretty similar, so downstream will need to be compared.

|HX8369 and/or SC7798
|HX8369 is in mainline, SC7798 is not. Both are enabled in the kernel config. Only SC7798 is present in my Grand Neo (TODO: There's apparently a dual-sim model. Does that use the same display?)

|Backlight
|KTD3102
|Not in mainline, and there doesn't seem to be a similar driver (by name).

Some information:

* There's a DTS in mainline but it's unused and the parts used don't match the defconfig. Seems like it's a generic tree and was never finished, as it matches some stuff in the board-java.c file in downstream.
