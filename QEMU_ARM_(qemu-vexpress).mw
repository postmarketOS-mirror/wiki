=== Usage ===
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap init  # Choose device "qemu-vexpress"
$ pmbootstrap install
$ pmbootstrap qemu --image-size=2G --display=gtk --arch=arm
</syntaxhighlight>

Using the <code>--display=gtk</code> parameter is recommended. The default display, SDL, will show two windows (of which one is unused) and you won't be able to look at the serial output. In the GTK interface, click on ''View / Show Tabs'' to display all available outputs as tabs next to each other. Check the <code>serial0</code> output for what it is actually doing as the boot will probably take a few minutes, unless you have a very fast PC.

=== What works ===
* Serial output
* Storage
* Network

=== What does not work ===
* '''Keyboard and mouse'''
* QEMU 2.0.0 is too old (but it's known to be working with 2.6.50)[https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1029#issuecomment-353819587]

=== Notes ===
* It boots only if you specify a separate <code>-dtb</code> flag, it doesn't use the dtb attached to the kernel (but pmbootstrap calls it right).
