This device is used to emulate an ARM Versatile Express for Cortex-A9.

Vexpress (Versatile Express) is the reference architecture from the ARM Foundation. It simulates the armv7 architecture and a lot of other hardware (like graphics hardware).

QEMU supports many other ARM architectures (see <code>qemu-system-arm -machine help</code>).
