==== WiFi workaround on boot ====

The wifi adapter works in networkmanager but it seems it boots in airplane mode. To make it detect wifi networks you need to disable and re-enable the wifi adapter.
This can be done in the graphic shell (Plasma Mobile has an airplane mode switch in the pull-down menu) or through the shell:

<source lang="shell-session">
$ nmcli radio all off
$ nmcli radio all on
</source>
