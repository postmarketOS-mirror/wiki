=== Fastboot Mode ===

First make sure to enable USB debugging in Android ([https://www.kingoapp.com/root-tutorials/how-to-enable-usb-debugging-mode-on-android-5-lollipop.htm])
Then with device powered off, hold down {{button|Volume Down}} and {{button|Power}} buttons simultaneously for a few seconds, until Fastboot Mode screen appears.

=== OEM Unlock ===

Get device into Fastboot Mode, plug in USB cable, then:

<source lang="shell-session">
$ sudo fastboot oem unlock
</source>

When prompted on device, use Volume-Up/Down buttons to highlight choice, then Power button to select it.  The Fastboot Mode screen will appear again, and a message regarding flashing will appear briefly.

=== Installation ===

First build the image:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap
$ cd pmbootstrap/
$ ./pmbootstrap.py init
$ ./pmbootstrap.py install --no-fde
</source>

Then in order to flash it put your device in fastboot mode, and plug it in USB. Then do:

<source lang="shell-session">
$ ./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_rootfs --partition userdata
$  sudo fastboot format system
$ ./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_kernel
</source>

=== Issues ===

==== WiFi workaround on boot ====
The wifi adapter works in NetworkManager, but it boots in airplane mode and NetworkManager does not detect that. Therefore at boot you need to disable the wifi adapter first, and then re-enable it. This can easily be done in the graphic shell (Plasma Mobile has an airplane mode switch in the pull-down menu: check it and uncheck it) or through the shell:

<source lang="shell-session">
$ nmcli radio all off
$ nmcli radio all on
</source>

==== Webbrowser ====
In plasma-mobile, Angelfish webbrowser does not run. You may want to install, configure and use qtwebbrowser, [[Firefox]] and/or [[Chromium]].
