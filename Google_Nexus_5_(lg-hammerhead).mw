=== Fastboot Mode ===

First make sure to enable USB debugging in Android ([https://www.kingoapp.com/root-tutorials/how-to-enable-usb-debugging-mode-on-android-5-lollipop.htm])
Then with device powered off, hold down Volume-Down and Power buttons simultaneously for a few seconds, until Fastboot Mode screen appears.

=== OEM Unlock ===

Get device into Fastboot Mode, plug in USB cable, then:

<source lang="shell-session">
$ fastboot oem unlock
</source>

When prompted on device, use Volume-Up/Down buttons to highlight choice, then Power button to select it.  The Fastboot Mode screen will appear again, and a message regarding flashing will appear briefly.

=== Installation ===

First build the image:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ ./pmbootstrap.py init
$ ./pmbootstrap.py install --no-fde
</source>

Then in order to flash it put your device in fastboot mode, and plug it in USB. Then do:

<source lang="shell-session">
$ ./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_rootfs --partition userdata
$  sudo fastboot format system
$ ./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_kernel
</source>

=== Issues ===

==== WiFi workaround on boot ====
The wifi adapter works in NetworkManager but it seems it boots in airplane mode. To make it detect wifi networks you need to disable and re-enable the wifi adapter.
This can be done in the graphic shell (Plasma Mobile has an airplane mode switch in the pull-down menu) or through the shell:

<source lang="shell-session">
$ nmcli radio all off
$ nmcli radio all on
</source>

==== Race condition on boot ====
Due to a race condition, the device might not always boot properly. With non-split installation you often need to reboot the device several times before it boots. ({{issue|5|linux-postmarketos}})

==== Backlight issues ====
The backlight is not regular and is disproportionately dim in lower-left corner (uneven backlighting?). [[User:Neilvandyke]] reported that backlight is very dim in general although a in a test in 09/2018 by [[User:pparent]] overall brightness is pretty good when setting backlight to 100% in plasma-mobile, while remaining uneven.
