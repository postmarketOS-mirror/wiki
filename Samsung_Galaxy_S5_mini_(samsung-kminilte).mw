=== Special keycombo's ===

Download/Flash/ODIN mode - Press and hold &quot;volume down + home + power&quot; simultaneously. Then click volume up to confirm.

Recovery - press and hold VOL+, PWR and HOME

=== Problems ===

* Currently, Heimdall seems to be unable to flash the device's <code>SYSTEM</code> partition, so we can't do the entire install using just <code>pmbootstrap flasher</code>.
* <code>udevadm trigger</code> causes a complete system freeze and eventual reboot. If you comment out that line in <code>start_weston.sh</code> and replace it by <code>udevadm trigger --attr-match=name=sec_touchscreen</code>, the touch screen should work.

=== Preparing for install ===

First, [https://eu.dl.twrp.me/kminilte/ download the TWRP recovery ROM]. You'll need both the <code>.img.tar</code> and the <code>.img</code> file. First, extract the tar file to obtain <code>recovery.img</code>. Then, put your phone in flash mode and flash using Heimdall:

<pre>$ heimdall flash --RECOVERY recovery.img --BOOT twrp-3.1.1-1-kminilte.img</pre>
Now you should be able to connect to the device using <code>adb</code>.

Note: Be aware that the stock Android ROM reflashes stock recovery upon boot, wiping TWRP out if you let it start booting.

=== Installing system ===

Follow [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Installation_guide the android-recovery-zip steps], using <code>samsung-kminilte</code> when the init commands asks. Heimdall is currently unable to flash the SYSTEM partition, and adb sideload method seems broken, so you will have to do <code>pmbootstrap export</code> after generating the recovery and pushing it to the phone while it is booted in TWRP via <code>adb push /tmp/postmarketOS-export/pmos-samsung-kminilte.zip /sdcard/</code>.

Then just flash it via recovery as you would a normal android ROM. Currently on Samsung devices you may get an error about unmounting .log files, it seems to work on second try but due to another issue you have to make sure SYSTEM is unmounted in TWRP before attempting to do so.

Also TWRP 3.2.0+ is currently not supported by default, so you'll have to apply workarounds if you're using that. See https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/1636

If you get an error <code>lddtree not found</code>, simply run <code>apk add lddtree</code> in the chroot environment and try again.

If you get the following errors:

<pre>device-mapper: reload ioctl on   failed: No such file or directory
Failed to setup dm-crypt key mapping for device /dev/block/mmcblk0p18.
Check that kernel supports aes-xts-plain64 cipher (check syslog for more info).</pre>
You can try to reinstall with a different cipher, by editing <code>install_options</code> and changing the <code>CIPHER</code> line to <code>CIPHER=&quot;aes-cbc-plain64&quot;</code>, re-zipping and using <code>adb sideload</code> again.

=== Installing kernel ===

This can be done via <code>./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_kernel</code>

It should boot, and show the Samsung splash screen. After that you should be able to [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/wiki/Boot-process connect via telnet]
