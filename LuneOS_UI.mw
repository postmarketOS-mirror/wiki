User interface from LuneOS, a continuation of webOS (Palm/HP's discontinued and open sourced mobile operating system updated with Wayland and QT5). A UI port is under development.[https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/629]


== Current Status ==

[[File:luna_qemu_pmos_dec13.png |thumb|left| LuneOS UI running in QEMU]]

The UI currently starts in QEMU, along with most of the core services. With lots of manual post-install tweaking, you can complete first-use, and view the main launcher, as well as start apps, as seen in the screenshot. These tweaks are being packaged so that they don't need to be done manually.

This does ''not'' mean porting work is done, there's still a ton of work to get something usable. See [https://trello.com/b/5tzrh9gw/luneos-porting magmastonealex's trello board] for more up-to-date status.

Current work can be found in [https://github.com/magmastonealex/pmbootstrap/tree/make-luna-start-properly magmastonealex]'s repository, with some work currently in master.

== Running ==

Install:

* postmarketos-ui-luna
* mesa-dri-virtio (if in QEMU, mesa-dri-swrast otherwise)
* mesa
* mesa-egl

Run /usr/bin/start_luna.sh to start 

== Major to-dos ==

* Running this on ARM (Blocked on JIT being broken on armhf. I don't have an aarch64 device to test yet.)
* Trying to get this running with software rendering (Mesa seems to theoretically support this, though I (magmastonealex) never got it working). Zhuowei has a lot of research [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/629 here].
* Getting the HAL working (nyx-lib). (Probably involved, but can support only a couple things at first)
* Create init service files to get services starting at boot.
* See [https://trello.com/b/5tzrh9gw/luneos-porting magmastonealex's trello board
