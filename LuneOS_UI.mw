User interface from LuneOS, a continuation of webOS (Palm/HP's discontinued and open sourced mobile operating system updated with Wayland and QT5).

== Unmaintained ==

We were able to present an initial version in [https://postmarketos.org/blog/2017/12/31/219-days-of-postmarketOS/#luneos-ui December of 2017]. But after that, LuneOS was unmaintained and didn't build anymore ({{issue|49|pmaports}}). '''The packages have been removed from postmarketOS.''' If you are interested in making it work again and maintaining the packages, [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/tree/0.6.0/aports/luna here are the old build recipies] for reference.

'''All information below is outdated.'''

== Running (QEMU) ==
{{note|Choosing luna in the UI selection in <code>pmbootstrap init</code> is not enough to make it start right now!}}
Install:

* postmarketos-ui-luna
* mesa-dri-virtio (if in QEMU)
* mesa
* mesa-egl

Edit /usr/bin/start_luna.sh, to set your desired input devices on the luna-next line. Run /usr/bin/start_luna.sh to start everything. The first-use app should open.

See also [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/629 The Github issue] for more instructions and ideas for getting this running on non-accelerated phones.

Complete the steps, when you get to the black screen, click where the "next" button should be. It's not clear what causes that yet.

Once the app exits and you're presented with the home screen, run '''luna-send -n 1 'luna://com.palm.configurator/run' '{"types":["dbkinds","dbpermissions","activities"]}'''' in another terminal. Stop luna, reboot, and start luna again, and everything should be usable.

== Major to-dos ==
* Running this on ARM (Everything is packaged. Currently seems to crash on non-hardware accellerated devices in swrast somewhere.)
* Trying to get this running with software rendering (Appears to work somewhat, no luck on armhf yet.) Zhuowei has a lot of research [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/629 here].
* Getting the HAL working (nyx-lib). (Probably involved, but can support only a couple things at first)
* Create init service files to get services starting at boot.
* See [https://trello.com/b/5tzrh9gw/luneos-porting magmastonealex's trello board]
* Applying the LuneOS patches for <code>qt5-qtwebengine</code> again. magmastonealex [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/tree/ac17316441ab522b9d7bbfcf53dc6f41d1420754/aports/main/qt5-qtwebengine made a version] that worked with QT 5.9, but these patches are incompatible with later QT versions (details: {{github|1459}})
