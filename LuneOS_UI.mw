User interface from LuneOS, a continuation of webOS (Palm/HP's discontinued and open sourced mobile operating system updated with Wayland and QT5). A UI port is under development.[https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/629]


== Current Status ==

[[File:luna_qemu_pmos_dec13.png |thumb|left| LuneOS UI running in QEMU]]

The UI currently starts in QEMU, along with most of the core services. With lots of manual post-install tweaking, you can complete first-use, and view the main launcher, as well as start apps, as seen in the screenshot. These tweaks are being packaged so that they don't need to be done manually.

This does ''not'' mean porting work is done, there's still a ton of work to get something usable. See [https://trello.com/b/5tzrh9gw/luneos-porting magmastonealex's trello board] for more up-to-date status.

Current work can be found in master.

See [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/629 The github issue] related to this work as well.
== Running (QEMU) ==

Install:

* postmarketos-ui-luna
* mesa-dri-virtio (if in QEMU)
* mesa
* mesa-egl

Run /usr/bin/start_luna.sh to start everything. The first-use app should open.

Complete the steps, when you get to the black screen, click where the "next" button should be. It's not clear what causes that yet.

Once the app exits and you're presented with the home screen, run '''luna-send -n 1 'luna://com.palm.configurator/run' '{"types":["dbkinds","dbpermissions","activities"]}'''' in another terminal. Stop luna, reboot, and start luna again, and everything should be usable.

== Major to-dos ==

* Running this on ARM (Everything is packaged. Currently seems to crash on non-hardware accellerated devices in swrast somewhere.)
* Trying to get this running with software rendering (Appears to work somewhat, no luck on armhf yet.) Zhuowei has a lot of research [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/629 here].
* Getting the HAL working (nyx-lib). (Probably involved, but can support only a couple things at first)
* Create init service files to get services starting at boot.
