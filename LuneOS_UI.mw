User interface from LuneOS, a continuation of webOS (Palm/HP's discontinued and open sourced mobile operating system updated with Wayland and QT5). A UI port is under development.[https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/629]


== Current Status ==

[[File:luna_qemu_pmos.png |thumb|left| LuneOS UI running in QEMU]]

The UI currently starts in QEMU, as do all of the core services (luna-sysmgr, luna-prefs, ls-hubd). You currently cannot proceed past the pulsing "LuneOS" logo because of missing services.

As of today, the mouse does not work, which precludes further testing to see what else may be broken.

Current work can be found in [https://github.com/magmastonealex/pmbootstrap/tree/postmarketos-ui-luna magmastonealex]'s repository, soon to be merged in to the `postmarketos-ui-luna` feature branch.


== Running ==

Install:

* luna-next-cardshell
* luna-sysmgr
* luna-sysservice
* luna-appmanager
* luneos-components
* luna-init
* mesa-dri-virtio (if in QEMU, mesa-dri-swrast otherwise)
* mesa
* mesa-egl

Run, in the same shell:

* ''export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libwayland-server.so.0''
* ''export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=eglfs''
* ''export QT_QUICK_BACKEND=softwarerenderer''
* ''export QML2_IMPORT_PATH=/''
* ''/usr/sbin/ls-hubd --conf /etc/luna-service2/ls-private.conf & ''
* ''/usr/sbin/ls-hubd --public --conf /etc/luna-service2/ls-public.conf &''
* ''luna-prefs-service -d & ''
* ''LunaSysMgr -l debug &''
* ''LunaSysService -l debug &''
* ''LunaAppManager -t -c -u luna &''
* ''luna-next''

== Major to-dos ==
* Finish packaging coreapps (configurator, activitymanager, db8, firstuseapp, webappmanager)
* Getting the mouse to work (probably a nyx-module)
* Running this on ARM (Needs a device with hardware acceleration & EGL support)
* Trying to get this running with software rendering (Mesa seems to theoretically support this, though I (magmastonealex) never got it working)
* Getting the HAL working (nyx-lib). (Probably involved, but can support only a couple things at first)
* Getting webapps to run (should theoretically just need to package luna-webappmanager)
* Packaging core luna apps (notes, messages, settings, etc.)
* Create init service files
* More packaging: ''luna-systemui'', ''luna-qml-launcher'', ''luna-applauncher'', ''luna-universalsearchmgr'' are all a start.
