== How to enter flash mode ==
Power off the device, hold down the power and the volume up key for 1-2 seconds. Some devices you may need to hold down the power and the volume down key instead.

== Pre-Installation Configuration ==
* Add <code>deviceinfo_flash_sparse="true"</code> the [[deviceinfo]][https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Deviceinfo_reference] file
* Replace ssh with dropbear

== Installation ==
Follow the [[Installation_guide]].

*Install PMOS
<source lang="bash">
pmbootstrap init
pmbootstrap install
pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs
pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel
</source>

ssh usermobile@172.16.42.1
</source>
