== How to enter flash mode ==
Power off the device, hold down the power and the volume up key for 1-2 seconds.

== Installation ==
Follow the [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap#usage installation guide]. Make sure to not use the <code>--fde</code> option, because initfs unlocking does not work yet.

== Display ==
XFCE4 works the best, you may have to run startx over ssh to get it to appear
