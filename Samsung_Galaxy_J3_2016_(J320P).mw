== How to enter flash mode ==
Press Volume Down, Power, and Home all at the same time to boot to Odin mode. After lk2nd is installed, press Volume Down and Power at the same time.

== Installation ==
# Install [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd#readme lk2nd] (alternative bootloader that provides a standard fastboot interface)
# Follow the [[Installation guide]]
{{note|'''Note:''' When installing lk2nd via Odin mode, I was unable to get Heimdall working as a flasher. You may need to use the Windows Odin program. I believe it works in Wine on Linux.}}
{{note|'''Note:''' Enter lk2nd fastboot mode by pressing only Volume Down + Power ('''not''' the Home button). Pressing the Home button additionally will bring you to the Samsung Download mode.}}
