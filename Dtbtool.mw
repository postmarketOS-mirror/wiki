The <code>dtbtool</code> is needed to combine multiple <code>dtb</code> ([[dtb|device tree blob]]) files into one <code>dt.img</code> file, that can then be attached to the end of the <code>boot.img</code> for Android devices (<code>postmarketos-mkinitfs</code> does that).

=== Do I need it? ===
You only need this tool if <code>pmbootstrap bootimg_analyze</code> on a known working boot.img file for your device outputs:
<pre>
deviceinfo_bootimg_qcdt="true"
</pre>

=== Using an alternative version ===
There exist lots of versions of this <code>dtbtool</code>. We have packaged the (Python) version from Skales now, which seems to be properly maintained and versioned. But it may have incompatibilities with some (older?) kernels, where the <code>dt.img</code> file was properly generated with code based on the original C version.

If you would like to test if Skales' version produces the same output as the LineageOS version (which is what we had packaged before), download the files from [https://github.com/ollieparanoid/aports-extra/tree/master/dtbtool-lineage here] and place them in <code>aports/main/dtbtool-lineage</code>. Build it with <code>pmbootstrap build dtbtool-lineage</code> and depend on <code>dtbtool-lineage</code> instead of <code>dtbtool</code> in your kernel package, then change the <code>dtbTool</code> line in your kernel APKBUILD to <code>dtbTool-lineage</code>.
