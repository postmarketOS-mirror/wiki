== What works ==
The kernel builds.

== What does not work ==
It does not boot (it goes straight to recovery).

According to [http://gpdroid.s3.amazonaws.com/revolution/BuildCM11forGPRev.pdf this document], the bootloader requires a signed ''boot.img'' so it might not be possible to use our own.

== How to enter flash mode ==
Press volume down and power button at the same time.

== Installation ==
The Revolution uses the Intel bootimg format, similar to the [[Asus Zenfone 5 (asus-t00f)]].

[https://github.com/coldnew-gp-revolution/revolution-boot-tools This tool] can be used to generate an image in this format.
