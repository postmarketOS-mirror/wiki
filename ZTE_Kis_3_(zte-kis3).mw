== How to enter flash mode ==

* Press volume down + power key until you see the, the boot logo will stay displayed.

or

* Boot into recovery or firefox/android and run <code>adb reboot bootloader</code>

== How to enter recovery mode ==

* Turn off the phone, e.g. by taking out battery or holding down Power button.
* Press and hold Volume Up + Home + Power button for about 5 seconds.
* Press Power button to enter recovery mode

or

* Press volume up + power key to enter recovery - on some other versions of the phone?

== Installation ==

Backup:

* Download TWRP recovery image (see links) and save as recovery.img
* Insert SDCard with enough space for backup
* Boot into bootloader (see How to enter flash mode above)
* Run <code>fastboot boot recovery.img</code> to boot the TWRP recovery without flashing it
* Go to 'Backup' and select SDCard as storage; swipe to start backup; wait until backup is finished. Take out SDCard.

Flashing TWRP:
* Boot into bootloader (<code>adb reboot bootloader</code>)
* Run <code>fastboot flash recovery recovery.img</code>

Flashing postmarket OS:

Flash using an external SD card for system, boot kernel without flashing through fastboot. Fastboot seems to crash when flashing system and using an Android recovery zip seemed unsuccessful as well. 

* [[Installation_guide|Follow the installation guide to init pmbootstrap]]
* Put pmos on an SD card: <code>pmbootstrap install --sdcard=/dev/sdX</code> (change /dev/sdX to the SD card)
* Put phone into fastboot mode (see above)
* Boot kernel without flashing: <code>pmbootstrap flasher boot</code>
* You should be able to see and ping the phone via network over USB soonish, but booting to the point where the ssh daemon runs takes really long (e.g. 8 minutes).
