== How to enter flash mode ==

Hold vol-down while booting the device. The splash screen doesn't indicate, that the phone is in fastboot mode, but you can test it by running <code>fastboot devices</code> on a PC that's connected via USB to the phone.

== Installation ==

Note, that you have to have a recent bootloader installed, you can download a zip to flash from the recovery [https://github.com/WeAreFairphone/modem_zip_generator/releases at this link].

Installation procedure is the same as with most other devices and isn't special for this phone.

== WiFi ==

Using NetworkManager (preinstalled) doesn't work for me / my WiFi network because of some dhcp issue.

Enable the <code>device-fairphone-fp2-nonfree-firmware</code> package during <code>pmbootstrap init</code>

Then run as root on the device:

<source>
# Stop NetworkManager as it interferes with wpa_supplicant
service networkmanager stop
# Start wpa_supplicant
wpa_supplicant -Dnl80211 -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
</source>

Connect to a network using [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/WPA_supplicant#Connecting_with_wpa_cli this guide].

<source>
# Start a DHCP client on the wlan0 interface to get an IP address
udhcpc -iwlan0
</source>

Then you should have a working WiFi connection!
