* The rest

== How to enter flash mode ==

As mentioned in [[#Installation]], fastboot does not work for flashing the system image (it does for the boot image), the TWRP Android recovery must be used. A current version can be downloaded from [https://twrp.me/devices/fairphone2.html twrp.me].

== Installation ==

As the Fairphone bootloader/lk has a bug that affects the flashing of large images via fastboot, the Android recovery zip option must be used and the resulting zip must be flashed from TWRP.

After that, it's as easy as rebooting and unlocking the phone via the telnet interface.
