== What works ==

* Flashing (needs bootloader patch)
* Booting
* Screen (needs the msm framebuffer hack)
* Touchscreen
* USB networking
* USB OTG
* WiFi

== What does not work ==

* The rest (probably)

== How to enter flash mode ==

Hold vol-down while booting the device. The splash screen doesn't indicate, that the phone is in fastboot mode, but you can test it by running "fastboot devices" on a PC that's connected via USB to the phone.

== Installation ==

As mentioned in [[#Installation]], the bootloader doesn't current support flashing images generated with the "img2simg" tool. It needs the patch [https://github.com/z3ntu/android_kernel_lk_fairphone_FP2/commit/0255581a47b96b8b0b3d7c5f0336d5f6bef8f2ad "app: aboot: Add support for CHUNK_FILL type for sparse image"] to work. This patch should be included in a future release from Fairphone. Contact @z3ntu to get instructions on how to patch the bootloader.

Installation procedure is the same as with most other devices and isn't special for this phone.
