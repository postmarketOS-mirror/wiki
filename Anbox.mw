'''[https://anbox.io Anbox]''' runs Android apps on Linux by running a (trimmed down?) version of Android next to Linux in a container. Using Anbox with Gapps installed would make it possible for a user to have both needed, sandboxed applications run alongside of native Linux programs. Having this working could be a major assistant in switch people off of Android into an operating that respects user privacy
