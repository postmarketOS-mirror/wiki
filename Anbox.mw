'''[https://anbox.io Anbox]''' runs Android apps on Linux by running a trimmed down version of Android in a container. Using Anbox installed would make it possible for a user to have both needed Android applications sandboxed, running alongside of native Linux programs. Having this working can be a major assistant to help people switch from Android to an operating that respects their privacy.

See issue {{issue|17|pmaports}} for current progress.

Anbox require an anbox0 bridge interface. It is currently created with network manager.
