__NOTOC__ __NOCACHE__
All the devices in this table can at least boot postmarketOS. To monitor boot progress, you must be able to receive output from the screen, a network adapter, or a serial port. If you verify that a device not on this list boots postmarketOS, please [[Help:Device Page|create a page for the device]] and make a [https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html merge request].

== Non-booting devices ==
The devices list below cannot boot postmarketOS (yet). As such, they have not been integrated into the postmarketOS source tree. Once the device becomes bootable, it might appear in this least until a pull-request to integrate the code has been accepted. If you have verified that a device in this list boots postmarketOS, please [https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/gitlab-basics/add-merge-request.html make a merge-request].

==Peripherals==
Have you tested a USB or Bluetooth peripheral with postmarketOS? Does the peripheral use open-source drivers and firmware? If so, please report your findings in this section. This can be especially helpful for users who wish to replace built-in a network adapter or GPS unit with one that supports free software.
 
===Wireless network adapters===
* Atheros [[AR9271]] chipset

===External GPS units===
