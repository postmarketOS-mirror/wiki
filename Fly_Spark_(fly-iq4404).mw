== How to enter flash mode ==
{{Button|Volume Up}} + {{Button|Power}} (loading Recovery)

Connect usb cable and enter:

<pre>sudo adb start-server</pre>

When Recovery is fully loaded

<pre>adb reboot bootloader</pre>

When the fastboot logo appears on the phone

== Installation ==
pmbootstrap creates a damaged boot.img, so you need to manually build boot.img
<pre>mtkimg repack newboot.img -n -k vmlinuz-fly-iq4404 -r initramfs-fly-iq4404</pre>

<pre>fastboot flash boot newboot.img</pre>
