== alsactl method ==
Cascardo reported having success with the following method on Debian, this should work for postmarketOS as well:
<blockquote>
I ran a debian chroot on a cyanogenmod, set the volume up, then ran alsactl save on the chroot. booted into debian, then after alsactl restore was run, I had audio working

so, in summary, it's hard to know which mixer settings will make it work, so my strategy was running some android stack that correctly set the mixer, then saving the state with a chroot or any other tool that would allow you to save, copy and restore that state later on a gnu stack

This method may work for non-Android devices as well, as long as you see an audio device in <code>alsamixer</code>. Just boot the normal OS, save the volume settings somehow, then restore them.
