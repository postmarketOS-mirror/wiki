== Notes ==
</li>
<li>I am using the LineageOS kernel found [https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_asus_grouper here]</li>
<li>The kernel cannot be compiled on versions of gcc newer than 4.9 without the appropriate patch</li>
<li>I could not get UART debugging through the headphone jack to work - as far as I can tell, and according to a few other sources I found, the 2012 version of the Nexus 7 does not have this feature.</li>
<li>CONFIG_VT had to be enabled for graphics to work. In menuconfig this is located under Device Drivers -&gt; Character devices -&gt; Virtual terminal.</li>
<li>/sys/class/graphics/fb0/mode is empty on boot, it must have U:800x1280p-0. This uses the same initfs hook as many other devices.</li>
<li>xwayland does not work.</li>
<li>weston with fbdev-backend.so uses pixman-type=3 (PIXMAN_TYPE_ABGR), which now does not require configuration.</li>
<li>The touchscreen input device is named <code>elan-touchscreen</code>.</li>
<li>The wifi chip is the Broadcom 4330.</li>
<li>This device was once officially supported on Ubuntu, so it has a firmware package in the [https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/linux-firmware-nexus7 Ubuntu repositories]</li>
<li>[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Nexus7/Kernel This page] includes a list of changes to the Android kernel that are not present in mainline Linux.</li>
<li>I was able to get networking over USB with an RTL8150 ethernet USB adapter by enabling the RTL8150 kernel config and following the [https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Configure_Networking network setup guide on the Alpine Linux wiki].</li>
<li><p>I was able to get wifi working by manually copying fw_bcmdhd.bin and nvram.txt to their kernel-specified locations and configuring <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>. At this point, I ran <code>/etc/init.d/networking restart</code>, which gave an error about being unable to get a MAC address. I restarted the device to find that wifi Just Workedâ„¢, and was able to successfully scan for wireless networks and establish a connection to my secured wireless AP.</p>

''Fun fact: <code>grouper</code> was the first tablet to run pmOS!''
