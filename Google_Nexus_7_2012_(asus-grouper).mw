* antonok

=== What works ===
* Boot process
* Telnet/SSH over USB
* Screen
* USB keyboard, mouse
* Touchscreen
* Wifi (somewhat hacky so far, will improve soon!)

=== What does not work ===
* weston-keyboard
* <s>Can't boot without reflashing boot (!) [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/834#issuecomment-341231881]</s> '''Update:''' Does not seem to be an issue any more
* Full-disk Encrpyion. Use <code>install --no-fde</code>

=== How to enter flash mode ===
* Connect a USB cable
* Power the device off
* Hold power + volume down
* <code>fastboot</code> should work when the green android appears on the screen

=== Installation process ===
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell" line='line'>
$ git clone https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap
$ cd pmbootstrap
$ ./pmbootstrap.py init
$ ./pmbootstrap.py install --no-fde
$ ./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_kernel
$ ./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_rootfs
</syntaxhighlight>

=== UI options ===
* Weston: Boots, but also occasionally reboots on its own.
* Hildon: Boots into a black screen. Poking some <code>/sys/</code> variables might make the screen flash or turn on, but it remains unusable
* XFCE4: Boots into a black screen.
* Mate: Can't flash. This is due to the <code>.img</code> file being bigger than the system partition size. See GitHub issues [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/1422] and [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/60].
* Luna: Can't flash. Same as Mate.
* KDE (Plasma-Mobile): Can't flash. Same as Mate. Which in turn wrecks your device partitions. This has happened even with <code>flasher flash_rootfs --partition userdata</code>

=== Notes ===
* I am using the LineageOS kernel found [https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_asus_grouper here]
* The kernel cannot be compiled on versions of gcc newer than 4.9 without the appropriate patch
* I could not get UART debugging through the headphone jack to work - as far as I can tell, and according to a few other sources I found, the 2012 version of the Nexus 7 does not have this feature.
* CONFIG_VT had to be enabled for graphics to work. In menuconfig this is located under Device Drivers -&gt; Character devices -&gt; Virtual terminal.
* <s>/sys/class/graphics/fb0/mode is empty on boot, it must have U:800x1280p-0. This uses the same initfs hook as many other devices.</s> '''Update:''' Seems to be correctly set now
* xwayland does not work.
* weston with fbdev-backend.so uses pixman-type=3 (PIXMAN_TYPE_ABGR), which now does not require configuration.
* The touchscreen input device is named <code>elan-touchscreen</code>.
* The wifi chip is the Broadcom 4330.
* This device was once officially supported on Ubuntu, so it has a firmware package in the [https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/linux-firmware-nexus7 Ubuntu repositories]
* "Desktop" Linux firmware are outdated. Check [https://android.googlesource.com/platform/hardware/broadcom/wlan/+/master/bcmdhd/firmware/bcm4330/ here] for latest one. 
* [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Nexus7/Kernel This page] includes a list of changes to the Android kernel that are not present in mainline Linux.
* <s>I was able to get networking over USB with an RTL8150 ethernet USB adapter by enabling the RTL8150 kernel config and following the [https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Configure_Networking network setup guide on the Alpine Linux wiki].</s> '''Update:''' Nothing special required anymore. Just boot up and use the [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/USB_Network#Assigning_an_IP_address DHCP networking process for USB networks]
* I was able to get wifi working by manually copying fw_bcmdhd.bin and nvram.txt to their kernel-specified locations and configuring <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>. At this point, I ran <code>/etc/init.d/networking restart</code>, which gave an error about being unable to get a MAC address. I restarted the device to find that wifi Just Workedâ„¢, and was able to successfully scan for wireless networks and establish a connection to my secured wireless AP.
* A newer kernel, that should work, can be found here (thanks to Jasper in IRC): https://github.com/Unlegacy-Android

''Fun fact: <code>grouper</code> was the first tablet to run pmOS!''
