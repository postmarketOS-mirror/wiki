=== What works ===

* Boot process
* Telnet/SSH over USB
* Screen
* USB keyboard, mouse
* Touchscreen
* Wifi (somewhat hacky so far, will improve soon!)

=== What does not work ===

* weston-keyboard
* Can't boot without reflashing boot (!) [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/834#issuecomment-341231881]

=== How to enter flash mode ===

* Connect a USB cable
* Power the device off
* Hold power + volume down
* <code>fastboot</code> should work when the green android appears on the screen

=== Notes ===

* I am using the LineageOS kernel found [https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_asus_grouper here]
* The kernel cannot be compiled on versions of gcc newer than 4.9 without the appropriate patch
* I could not get UART debugging through the headphone jack to work - as far as I can tell, and according to a few other sources I found, the 2012 version of the Nexus 7 does not have this feature.
* CONFIG_VT had to be enabled for graphics to work. In menuconfig this is located under Device Drivers -&gt; Character devices -&gt; Virtual terminal.
* /sys/class/graphics/fb0/mode is empty on boot, it must have U:800x1280p-0. This uses the same initfs hook as many other devices.
* xwayland does not work.
* weston with fbdev-backend.so uses pixman-type=3 (PIXMAN_TYPE_ABGR), which now does not require configuration.
* The touchscreen input device is named <code>elan-touchscreen</code>.
* The wifi chip is the Broadcom 4330.
* This device was once officially supported on Ubuntu, so it has a firmware package in the [https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/linux-firmware-nexus7 Ubuntu repositories]
* [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Nexus7/Kernel This page] includes a list of changes to the Android kernel that are not present in mainline Linux.
* I was able to get networking over USB with an RTL8150 ethernet USB adapter by enabling the RTL8150 kernel config and following the [https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Configure_Networking network setup guide on the Alpine Linux wiki].
* I was able to get wifi working by manually copying fw_bcmdhd.bin and nvram.txt to their kernel-specified locations and configuring <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>. At this point, I ran <code>/etc/init.d/networking restart</code>, which gave an error about being unable to get a MAC address. I restarted the device to find that wifi Just Workedâ„¢, and was able to successfully scan for wireless networks and establish a connection to my secured wireless AP.
* A newer kernel, that should work, can be found here (thanks to Jasper in IRC): https://github.com/Unlegacy-Android

''Fun fact: <code>grouper</code> was the first tablet to run pmOS!''
