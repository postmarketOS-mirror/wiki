[https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon-processors-410 MSM8916]/[https://www.qualcomm.com/products/apq8016e APQ8016] (or Snapdragon 410) is Qualcomm SoC released in 2014. Support in mainline was originally added for the [https://www.96boards.org/product/dragonboard410c/ Dragonboard 410c], but most of it also works well on other MSM8916-based devices.

== Status ==
The following features provided by the MSM8916 SoC are supported in mainline and should work on most MSM8916-based devices after the device tree has been set up:
* UART
* USB
* Internal/External Storage (eMMC/SD card)
* WiFi/Bluetooth
* GPU, Display ('''Note:''' There are many different display panels and each needs a custom panel driver...)
* Sound ('''Note:''' Some devices use a custom speaker amplifier instead of the one provided by PM8916...)
* Buttons

Certain components (e.g. touchscreen, sensors, ...) are device-specific. With a bit of luck, some will be already supported by mainline, others won't.

== Overview ==
The first MSM8916 devices using mainline were added in {{MR|582|pmaports}}. The following components are involved when running mainline on MSM8916 devices.

=== [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/linux msm8916-mainline/linux] ===
The close-to-mainline [https://www.kernel.org/ Linux] kernel fork with patches that have not been accepted/submitted upstream yet. Patches in the <code>master</code> branch are generally in good shape unless marked otherwise. Submit a PR to add new patches there.

=== [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd msm8916-mainline/lk2nd] ===
The reference bootloader provided by Qualcomm for MSM8916 is open-source and based on [https://github.com/littlekernel/lk Little Kernel (LK)]. Most devices will use this bootloader in a more or less modified form. On Samsung devices for example, the standard Fastboot interface was replaced by their proprietary download mode.

[https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd lk2nd] is a fork of the reference bootloader with the goal to provide an unified boot interface on all MSM8916 devices. It provides a standard Fastboot interface (even on Samsung devices!). It also used for a number of mainline quirks (e.g. to set a WiFi/BT MAC address in the device tree; without lk2nd, WiFi/BT does not work out of the box). Eventually, more quirks may be added in the future. It is therefore recommended for all mainline MSM8916 devices. Porting it is generally much easier than porting mainline.

{{note|'''Note:''' lk2nd does not replace your stock bootloader. It is packed into a standard Android boot image and loaded by the stock bootloader from the boot partition. The real boot partition used by lk2nd is then placed with 1 MB offset into the boot partition.}}

=== soc-qcom-msm8916 ===
The shared device package in postmarketOS. It contains shared dependencies and configuration files.

== Getting Started ==
=== Requirements ===
* MSM8916-based device
* UART if possible (with a bit of luck you may get USB working without UART)
* (Downstream) Linux kernel source for your device (explaining ways to mainline without kernel source is out of scope for this article)
* Basic knowledge about Linux, Git, C, Device Trees, ...
* Willingness to learn about "mainlining" and to figure out things on your own

=== Before You Start ===
{{note|'''Warning:''' Mainlining (or any unintended "modding") may brick your device permanently if you make a mistake. There is a good chance that nothing happens if you are a bit careful, but do not continue with a device that you need every day. You have been warned!}}

Mainlining is not easy. MSM8916 is a platform where a lot components can be easily enabled by only setting up a device tree, which can be largely copied from other devices with minor changes. However, at some point you will reach the point where you would like to enable a particular component that is device-specific (e.g. the touchscreen, sensors, ...). In this case you will be largely on your own, and need to figure out how to enable it yourself. (Do you just need to add something to the device tree or even write a new kernel driver?) That requires some familiarity with the way the Linux kernel is working for MSM8916.

The best way to make yourself familiar with the process is to attempt to figure out some simple things on your own. Therefore, this guide will only describe everything until (eventually) USB network is working. For everything else, this article provides only some information that might be helpful to figure it out yourself.

If you have any questions, ask in [[Matrix_and_IRC|the mainline channel on Matrix or IRC]]. Make sure to mention "msm8916" if your question is specific to this article.

=== Preparations ===
First, let's take a short look at the downstream kernel. The device trees on downstream are usually in <code>arch/arm/boot/dts/qcom/msm8916-*.dts(i)</code> (in Samsung kernels: <code>arch/arm/boot/dts/samsung/msm8916/msm8916-*.dts(i)</code>). You need to find the <code>.dts</code> file that describes the device tree for your device. One way to check this is to look at <code>/proc/device-tree/model</code> on downstream, and search for the same string in that directory.

Now, let's check how it looks on mainline. Clone [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/linux msm8916-mainline/linux] and take a look at <code>arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/</code>. This is the directory where you will add your device tree later.

=== Porting lk2nd ===
{{note|'''Note:''' lk2nd is not strictly required to boot mainline. However, certain features (e.g. WiFi and BT) only work with some additional mainline quirks included in lk2nd. In the future, there may be more features that depend on extra code that needs to be run in the bootloader. Therefore, lk2nd is recommended for all devices, even if your stock bootloader already provides a standard Fastboot interface.}}

[https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd msm8916-mainline/lk2nd] does not require any device-specific code. Normally, it should just run out of the box on your device. However, most stock bootloaders require a valid device tree to be present in the Android boot image. To avoid problems, a dummy device tree with the "qcom,board-id" from the downstream kernel needs to be added to lk2nd.

Before you make any changes, try [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd#building building it]. Then, add a new file for your device to <code>dts/</code> that looks like:

 // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-only
 
 /dts-v1/;
 
 /include/ "msm8916.dtsi"
 
 / {
 	// This is used by the bootloader to find the correct DTB
 	qcom,msm-id = <206 0>; // qcom,msm-id = <247 0>; for APQ8016
 	qcom,board-id = /* Check your downstream device tree */;
 
 	model = "Example Device"; // TODO
 	compatible = "vendor,example", "qcom,msm8916", "lk2nd,device";
 };

Make sure to add the new file to <code>dts/rules.mk</code>, and re-compile lk2nd.

With a bit of luck, flashing the boot image on your device should make it boot into a Fastboot screen, and the device should show up via USB. If either of that is not the case, we need to investigate further. Sometimes, there is some kind of [[Micro-USB_Interface_Controller]] that sits between USB and the SoC, which may require manual setup to work correctly. Setting that up would require device-specific code. If you need help, ask in [[Matrix_and_IRC|the mainline channel on Matrix or IRC]].

=== Device Package ===
Before you can build the mainline kernel for your device, you need to setup the postmarketOS device packages. Avoid creating the device/kernel package directly through pmbootstrap. There is no need to analyze a boot image. (The boot image offsets are not actually used on MSM8916; all MSM8916 devices should use Fastboot through lk2nd...) You can start with the following examples:

To load a generic kernel image, the device must be able to find the correct device tree. MSM8916 devices usually use [[QCDT]] (multiple device tree blobs (dtb) are packaged in one Android boot image; the correct one is selected based on the <code>qcom,board-id</code>). However, not all devices implement the specification correctly: For example, all Samsung devices use the same <code>qcom,board-id</code> - it is therefore useless to pick the correct device tree. In that case, we append a single DTB to the kernel image instead and load it directly from there (note: works only with lk2nd).

{{todo|Explain how to check if the device implements the QCDT specification properly.}}

* '''QCDT:''' Uncomment <code>deviceinfo_bootimg_qcdt="true"</code> {{todo|Explain how to figure out which <code>compatible</code> string to use in this case.}}
* '''Appended device tree:''' Uncomment <code>deviceinfo_append_dtb="true"</code>

Follow the [[Porting_to_a_new_device#Device_specific_package|postmarketOS porting guide]] until the device package builds successfully. From now on you will use [[Compiling_kernels_with_envkernel.sh|envkernel.sh]] to compile the kernel.
