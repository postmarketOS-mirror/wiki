Mediatek flashing protocol

If you want to flash firmware to Mediatek-based devices, there is a proprietary Tool for that: [https://spflashtool.com/ SPflahstool].

It is e.g. used for the [[Wiko Lenny 3 (wiko-lenny3)]]

Some open source software has been developed, see

https://github.com/saleemrashid/mediatek_flash_tool has only been tested with the MT6580

https://github.com/MediaTek-Labs/mt76x7-uploader which is compatible with the MT7687 and MT7697 for flashing the bootloader

https://github.com/Wiz-IO/Mediatek-MT2625-Flash-Utility for the MT2625

https://github.com/McBitter/flasher only support for MT6735P, is WIP
