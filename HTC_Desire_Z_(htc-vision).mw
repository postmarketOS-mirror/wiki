* (everyone on IRC)

== What works ==

* Display (framebuffer), 16 bit color depth
* Touchscreen
* Keyboard
* USB networking
* vibrator

== What doesn't work ==

* 32 bit color depth ("red screen" issue)
* Wifi ({{issue|1513}})

== Progress ==

What's been done:

* device-htc-vision builds
* linux-htc-vision builds (using [https://github.com/milaq/android_kernel_htc_vision milaq's kernel])
* device boots

Cmdrwgls created pull request {{github|810}} with his work. This work was later finished by mberndt in {{MR|132|pmaports}}. Note that as of 2019-02-09 this branch isn't merged yet, though it works.

== Installation Notes ==
Obviously you need an unlocked bootloader; refer to [http://htcdev.com] for instructions about that. S-OFF is not needed.

Installing the rootfs using fastboot doesn't work due to size limitations in the bootloader, therefore if you want to install postmarketOS to the internal memory, do an [[Android Recovery Zip Installation]]. postmarketOS is picky when it comes to the recovery. It works with CWM 6.0.5.0, see [https://milaq.net/downloads/android/vision/misc/]. It does ''not'' work with CWM 6.0.4.5 or TWRP 2.6.3.0.

== Next steps ==

* test more hardware: audio, camera, radio, bluetoothâ€¦
* probably more firmware blobs are needed to get some of these working
