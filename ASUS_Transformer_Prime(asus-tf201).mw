Katkiss 7.1

== Status ==
* Kernel compiles
* Flashable from within recovery (same as [[Asus_Eee_Pad_Transformer_Prime]])
* Doesn't go beyond bootlogo
* Having problems compiling with APANIC flag (to read last_kmesg - and figure out why) 

== How to enter flash mode ==
Longpress power (for reboot), then lower sound (to bootloader), and from bootloader higher sound to jump to recovery

== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->
