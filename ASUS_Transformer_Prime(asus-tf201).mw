Katkiss android [https://forum.xda-developers.com/transformer-tf700/development/rom-t3457417 XDA link]

== Status ==
* Kernel compiles
* Flashable from within recovery (same as [[ASUS_Eee_Pad_Transformer_(asus-tf101)]])
* Doesn't go beyond bootlogo
* Having problems compiling with APANIC flag (to read last_kmesg - and figure out why)

== How to enter flash mode ==
Longpress power (for reboot), then during reboot (feel the vibration) lower sound (to bootloader), and from bootloader higher sound to jump to recovery

== Installation ==
You need to be running Katkiss 7.1 (with TWRP 3.0.0 and hairy bean bootloader). Please follow this [https://forum.xda-developers.com/transformer-prime/help/guide-tutorial-asus-transformer-prime-t3486237 guide on XDA] if you're not.

# <pre>./pmbootstrap.py install --no-fde</pre>
# <pre>./pmbootstrap.py export</pre>
# Reboot the device in recovery
# <pre>adb push /tmp/postmarketOS-export/blob-asus-tf201 /cache</pre>
# <pre>adb push /tmp/postmarketOS-export/asus-tf201.img /cache</pre>

The following should be executed within adb shell:

# <pre>adb shell</pre>
# <pre>dd if=/cache/blob-asus-tf201 of=/dev/block/mmcblk0p4</pre>
# <pre>dd if=/cache/asus-tf201.img of=/dev/block/mmcblk0p1</pre>

Note: Other ways of flashing do not work. This is exactly how the katkiss android ROM is flashed to the device.
