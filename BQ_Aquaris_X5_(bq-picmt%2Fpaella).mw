== How to enter flash mode ==
=== BQ bootloader ===
* '''Recovery''': Power on the device with both <code>Power</code> and <code>Volume Up</code> buttons.
* '''Fastboot''': Power on the device with both <code>Power</code> and <code>Volume Down</code> buttons.

=== Cyanogen bootloader ===
* '''Recovery''': Power on the device with both <code>Power</code> and <code>Volume Down</code> buttons.
* '''Stock fastboot''': Power on the device with both <code>Power</code> and <code>Volume Up</code> buttons.
* '''lk2nd Fastboot''': Power on the device. After it vibrates, hold <code>Volume Down</code>.

== Installation ==
=== Unlock bootloader ===
To unlock your bootloader, boot into Android, enable Developer Options from the settings and enable "Allow OEM unlock". Then boot into Fastboot and use <code>fastboot oem unlock</code>. You might need to use <code>fastboot oem unlock-go</code>. ('''Note:''' All your data will be erased!)

=== Firmware ===
It is recommended to flash to latest firmware from BQ before using postmarketOS. You can download it here: [https://storage.googleapis.com/otas/2015/Smartphones/X5/Android_N/5.2.0_20180228-1305-picmt-user-637-Fastboot-FW.zip 5.2.0_20180228-1305-picmt-user-637-Fastboot-FW.zip].

First flash the early boot firmware:

 $ fastboot flash sbl1 sbl1.mbn
 $ fastboot flash sbl1bak sbl1.mbn
 $ fastboot flash tz tz.mbn
 $ fastboot flash tzbak tz.mbn
 $ fastboot flash hyp hyp.mbn
 $ fastboot flash hypbak hyp.mbn
 $ fastboot flash rpm rpm.mbn
 $ fastboot flash rpmbak rpm.mbn
 $ fastboot flash modem NON-HLOS.bin

As a next step you also need to flash a Linux/Android bootloader (<code>aboot</code>). This depends if you want to run downstream (<code>bq-picmt</code> in postmarketOS) or mainline (<code>bq-paella</code> in postmarketOS).

==== Downstream ====
You can use the bootloader from the BQ firmware you downloaded before:

 $ fastboot flash aboot emmc_appsboot.mbn
 $ fastboot flash splash splash.img

The bootloader has a splash screen with white/black background (likely depending on the color of your device).

==== Mainline/Downstream ====
The BQ bootloader is unable to boot [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd lk2nd], therefore you need to flash the bootloader from the Cyanogen firmware. You can download it here: [https://storage.googleapis.com/support-files.bq.com/Bootloader/Cyanogen%20OS/cm-13.1.4-ZNH2KAS5FE-paella-signed-fastboot-a6851b4fbe.zip cm-13.1.4-ZNH2KAS5FE-paella-signed-fastboot-a6851b4fbe.zip]

 $ fastboot flash aboot emmc_appsboot.mbn
 $ fastboot flash splash splash.img

The bootloader has a splash screen with black background.

=== postmarketOS ===
==== Downstream ====
Choose <code>bq-picmt</code> and follow the [[Installation guide]].

==== Mainline ====
# Install [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd lk2nd] following the [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd#building Building] section (just needed the first time).
# Choose <code>bq-paella</code> and follow the [[Installation guide]] (flash from lk2nd, not the Cyanogen fastboot).

== Audio ==
See [[Qualcomm_Snapdragon_410_(MSM8916)#Audio]].

== Modem ==
See [[Qualcomm_Snapdragon_410_(MSM8916)#Modem]].

== Status ==
Currently work is separated based on firmware installed, if you installed the Cyanogen Edition firmware will be referred as bq-paella, if you installed the BQ Android firmware it will be referred as bq-picmt. So here is a summary for both:

'''bq-picmt:''' runs on downstream kernel

Works:
USB Network,
WiFi,
Display,
weston,
weston-calibrator

Buggy:
ts_calibrate: to make screen get touches I incrementally have to touch screen with one finger and then with that finger on screen touch the crosshair, then for the second two fingers and crosshair, for the third three fingers and crosshair...don't know why but it started happening when I replaced my broken screen with a new one, if someone has this device with original screen can check if the same issue is present or not

Modem doesn't work, in dmesg I get DATA5_CNTL error relative to no such device

'''bq-paella:''' runs on mainline kernel

Works:
USB Network,
WiFi,
Bluetooth,
Display,
Touchscreen,
Volume buttons,
Accelerometer,
Gyroscope,
Magnetometer,
Touchkeys backlight,
Audio (Headphones, Earpiece, Speaker, MIC),
Voice calls,
SMS
