=== SSH Config ===
When postmarketOS is reinstalled, a new ssh host key will be generated. Your SSH client will detect this, and refuse to connect, requiring you to run <code>ssh-keygen -R 172.16.42.1</code> each time a new host key is generated.

To disable this check, and to allow you to connect by running <code>ssh postmarketos</code>, add the following to your <code>~/.ssh/config</code>:
 Host postmarketos
     HostName 172.16.42.1
     StrictHostKeyChecking no
     UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null

{{note|'''Warning''': Ignoring host keys could leave you vulnerable to a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack Man-in-the-middle attack]}}

=== SSH with Suckless Terminal ===
When you ssh into postmarktetos using the suckless terminal (st), you will get errors with vim:

<source>
E558: Terminal entry not found in terminfo
'st' not known. Available builtin terminals are:
    builtin_amiga

Furthermore, gpg will refuse to work with errors like:
</source>

Furthermore, gpg will refuse to decrypt files and return the following error:
<source>
gpg: public key decryption failed: Required environment variable not set
gpg: decryption failed: No secret key
</source>

To fix, simply add <code>export TERM=xterm</code> to your <code>~/.profile</code>.

=== Some interesting ideas ===
Here are some interesting ideas that you can do with your device with postmarketOS
* Use it as a mini retro handheld gaming device. As there are many good retro emulator that ccan make your device one great gaming device.
* Use it as a mini penetration testing device. As postmarketOS is a pure linux os, you can run [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireshark Wireshark] and other penetration testing software with it.
* You can run full Desktop Environment, with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape Inkscape], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIMP GIMP] and full desktop browser(not mobile version) with extension in your device, .

=== VNC connection ===
Using x11vnc, which is in the Alpine repos. You need a running X server (e.g. running XFCE), then you just run x11vnc on the device in a terminal/tty and connect to it. From there, you can manipulate the previously running X server.
You might need to specify the X server if x11vnc does not detect it (e.g. by passing -display :0 to it or doing a export DISPLAY=:0 before running it, assuming the display is at :0)

=== Update the architecture of your device ===

Some devices have the armhf-architecture but the device supports armv7. Some Interfaces can not be built for armhf, so it could be useful to update the architecture:
* Update the architecture in the following files:
<source>
device/device-samsung-foo/APKBUILD
device/device-samsung-foo/deviceinfo
device/linux-samsung-foo/APKBUILD
</source>

* Update the name of the config-wiki-example.armhf in device/linux-wiki-example

* Create new Checksums, build the kernel and boot.

Due to CI-Updates in the Gitlab-repository it may be necessary to also [[Downstream_kernel_specific_package#Modernize_your_aport|modernize your aport]] before you can [[Git_workflow|upstream your work]].

=== Misc ===
* The splash screen is [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/206#issuecomment-316791430 highly configurable] (scroll down for an example)!
* Browse the Linux source with links to all references [http://elixir.free-electrons.com here]
* Qualcomm and maybe some other Androids can simply reboot from postmarketOS (or any Linux distro) into your bootloader or recovery with <code>reboot -f bootloader</code> and <code>reboot -f recovery</code>
* Battery capacity can be monitored to trigger low battery actions. See [[Battery capacity monitoring]] for more information.

=== Copy a port ===
If you know a port of another device is working on your device too, you can copy the port.

Arguments for copying a port:
* You cannot make your device booting yourself or want to safe the time to do it.
* There are no kernel sources available for your device
* The devices are very similar (e.g. same SoC), but you need little adjustments

Keep in mind that if you copy a port you always copy all problems and bugs too. For example it can be better to create a new up-to-date port then copying a port which only compiles under gcc6 and still uses armhf.

If you want to copy the port of a device, copy all the files of the device in your device-folder and rename them to the new ones. Now simply follow the porting guide. If the config-file of your new device is available try to use it instead of the old one.
