=== SSH Config ===
When postmarketOS is reinstalled, a new ssh host key will be generated. Your SSH client will detect this, and refuse to connect, requiring you to run <code>ssh-keygen -R 172.16.42.1</code> each time a new host key is generated.

To disable this check, and to allow you to connect by running <code>ssh postmarketos</code>, add the following to your <code>~/.ssh/config</code>:
 Host postmarketos
     HostName 172.16.42.1
     StrictHostKeyChecking no
     UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
