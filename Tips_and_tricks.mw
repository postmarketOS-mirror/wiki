=== SSH Config ===
When postmarketOS is reinstalled, a new ssh host key will be generated. Your SSH client will detect this, and refuse to connect, requiring you to run <code>ssh-keygen -R 172.16.42.1</code> each time a new host key is generated.

To disable this check, and to allow you to connect by running <code>ssh postmarketos</code>, add the following to your <code>~/.ssh/config</code>:
 Host postmarketos
     HostName 172.16.42.1
     StrictHostKeyChecking no
     UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null

{{note|'''Warning''': Ignoring host keys could leave you vulnerable to a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack Man-in-the-middle attack]}}

* Qualcomm and maybe some other Androids can simply reboot from postmarketOS (or any Linux distro) into your bootloader or recovery with <code>reboot -f bootloader</code> and <code>reboot -f recovery</code>
* Battery capacity can be monitored to trigger low battery actions. See [[Battery capacity monitoring]] for more information.
