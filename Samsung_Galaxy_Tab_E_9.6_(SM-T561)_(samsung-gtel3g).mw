== How to enter flash mode ==
* Recovery mode: Hold volume up, power button and home button
* Download mode(Odin/Heimdall): Hold volume down, power button and home button[flashing via download mode doesn't work]

== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. WiFi, photos, ... -->
* pmbootstrap install --android-recovery-zip
* pmbootstrap flasher --method=adb sideload

== Addional Notes ==
* ADB sideload stops at 50%, but it actually succeeds.
* The power button instantly shuts down the entire system
* Only Weston works, other interfaces don't work. SSH works even when the display is stuck at the Samsung boot animation
* Android apps that generate specs have produced conflicting reports about the device's memory. The device actually has 1.5 GB of memory.
