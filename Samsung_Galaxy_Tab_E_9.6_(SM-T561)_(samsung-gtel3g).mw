== How to enter flash mode ==
* <b>Recovery mode:</b> Hold volume up, power button and home button
* <b>Download mode(Odin/Heimdall):</b> Hold volume down, power button and home button[flashing via download mode doesn't work]

== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. WiFi, photos, ... -->
* <code>pmbootstrap install --android-recovery-zip</code>
* <code>pmbootstrap flasher --method=adb sideload</code>

== Addional Notes ==
* ADB sideload stops at 50%, but it actually succeeds.
* When running portnarketOS power button instantly shuts down the entire system
* <code>Xfce4</code> works like a charm but it needs to be manually started over <code>SSH</code>
* Android apps that generate specs have produced conflicting reports about the device's memory. The device actually has 1.5 GB of memory.
* You probably already know this but if you ever find yourself in a bootloop/soft-brick situation, hold donwn the volume keys, the home and the power button to reboot.
