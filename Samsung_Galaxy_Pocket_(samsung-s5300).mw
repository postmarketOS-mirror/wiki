contact me if you're interested, and I'll share my aports/device/*-samsung-s5300

until I get a "DIY UART jig" from eBay, there's not gonna be much

== Installation ==
enter flash mode

try to flash boot.img with Heimdall

when it doesn't work:

clone Heimdall sources from https://gitlab.com/BenjaminDobell/Heimdall.git

follow this advice: https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/Heimdall/issues/340

build Heimdall

flash boot.img with your newly compiled Heimdall (to KERNEL partition. DEFINITELY NOT TO "BOOT" partition, that's BOOTloader)

if it doesn't work:

make sure to reboot after every unsuccessful attempt


watch it not work

get a UART and help me find what's going on
