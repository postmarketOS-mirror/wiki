== What works ==
* Kernel compiles
== What does not work ==
* Kernel (stuck at bootloader logo)
== How to enter flash mode ==
Volume down + Home button while powering up
== Downloads? ==
contact me if you're interested, and I'll share my aports/device/*-samsung-s5300

until I get a "DIY UART jig" from eBay, there's not gonna be much

== Installation ==
enter flash mode

try to flash boot.img with Heimdall

when it doesn't work:

clone Heimdall sources from https://gitlab.com/BenjaminDobell/Heimdall.git

follow this advice: https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/Heimdall/issues/340

build Heimdall

flash boot.img with your newly compiled Heimdall (to KERNEL partition. DEFINITELY NOT TO "BOOT" partition, that's BOOTloader)

if it doesn't work:

make sure to reboot after every unsuccessful attempt


watch it not work

get a UART and help me find what's going on

If you wish to help with analysis: http://Mis012.nejlepsiserialy.cz/nextcloud/index.php/s/5jL92J6rL6LbMR8
(images extracted with binwalk, PARAM mounted within CWM; efs dd'd from /dev/block/mmcblk0, mmcblk0p10 is all zeros. 'security' :P)

https://datasheet.octopart.com/FSA880UMX-ON-Semiconductor-datasheet-86696689.pdf - The IC used for detecting resistor value between USB_ID and USB_GND. Not as full-featured as the mighty FSA9480, but as can be seen in the service manual, it is indeed connected to UART. (Also JTAG-[Rx/Tx] seems to be connected to the same lines, and it has it's own connection to USB_ID, so some resistor value might enable that. If it's not Factory Mode Boot [ON/OFF]-UART, though, I²C is needed to switch the MUX.)

https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=820275 - FSA9480 info, and some ways Samsung utilizes it. Some velues are certainly off, but there could be some similarities in the 'Unknown Accessory' territory, i.e. 121K and 150K relate to UART, which we have. And of course that one can only switch the MUX manually over I²C, so that would explain why the Primary Bootloader log isn't there - it might not speak i2c!
