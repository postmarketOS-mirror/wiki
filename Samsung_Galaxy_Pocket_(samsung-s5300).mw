* [[User:Mis012|Mis012]](since this is armv6 device, I will probably not continue working on this, contact me if you're interested, and I'll share my aports/device/*-samsung-s5300)

== Device owners ==
{{Device owners}}

== What works ==
* Kernel compiles

== What does not work ==
* Kernel (stuck at bootloader logo)

== How to enter flash mode ==
{{button|Volume down}} + {{button|Home}} while powering up

== Installation ==
* enter flash mode
* try to flash boot.img with [[Manual_flashing#Heimdall|Heimdall]]

=== Troubleshooting Installation ===
* clone Heimdall sources from https://gitlab.com/BenjaminDobell/Heimdall.git
* follow this advice: https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/Heimdall/issues/340
* build Heimdall
* flash boot.img with your newly compiled Heimdall (to KERNEL partition. DEFINITELY NOT TO "BOOT" partition, that's BOOTloader)
* make sure to reboot after every unsuccessful attempt

If you wish to help with analysis: http://Mis012.nejlepsiserialy.cz/nextcloud/index.php/s/5jL92J6rL6LbMR8
(images extracted with binwalk, PARAM mounted within CWM; efs and Reserved dd'd from /dev/block/mmcblk0, mmcblk0p10 is all zeros. 'security' :P)

* https://datasheet.octopart.com/FSA880UMX-ON-Semiconductor-datasheet-86696689.pdf - The IC used for detecting resistor value between USB_ID and USB_GND. Not as full-featured as the mighty FSA9480, but as can be seen in the service manual, it is indeed connected to UART. EDIT: JTAG-[Rx/Tx] seems to be connected to the same lines, so if you solder to corresponding pads near tag you can use usb at the same time.
* https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=820275 - FSA9480 info, and some ways Samsung utilizes it. Some values are certainly off, but there could be some similarities in the 'Unknown Accessory' territory, i.e. 121K and 150K relate to UART, which we have. EDIT: may not apply to all muxes: And of course that one can only switch the MUX manually over I²C, so that would explain why the Primary Bootloader log isn't there - it might not speak i2c!
