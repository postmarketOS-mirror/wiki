== Unlock bootloader ==
To do anything useful on this device, it's bootloader needs to be unlocked. This sadly requires creating an account on HTCDev.

Instructions can be found [https://www.htcdev.com/bootloader here]. Select "All Other Supported Models" on the right side and press "Begin Unlock Bootloader".

== Port status ==
Kernel can be compiled with GCC6, boots with CONFIG_VT disabled (because of that the framebuffer and SSH doesn't work, kernel panics if you enable it), USB networking is disabled because of build issues.
