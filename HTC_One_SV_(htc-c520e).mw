== Unlock bootloader ==
To do anything useful on this device, it's bootloader needs to be unlocked. This sadly requires creating an account on HTCDev.

Instructions can be found [https://www.htcdev.com/bootloader here]. Select "All Other Supported Models" on the right side and press "Begin Unlock Bootloader".

== Port status ==
Kernel can be compiled with GCC4, boots, USB networking works.
Matchbox works partially (only the bottom menu bar works).

== Enter fastboot ==
* Power + Volume Down buttons (that boots the device into HBOOT, use the volume buttons and power to select Fastboot) or use TWRP reboot bootloader, or <code>adb reboot bootloader</code>

== Installing ==
* Boot to fastboot
* Install rootfs to the SD card (<code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs</code> currently fails due to signature checking)
* Run <code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</code>
* Reboot
