== Unlock bootloader ==
To do anything useful on this device, it's bootloader needs to be unlocked. This sadly requires creating an account on HTCDev.

Instructions can be found [https://www.htcdev.com/bootloader here]. Select "All Other Supported Models" on the right side and press "Begin Unlock Bootloader".

== Port status ==
* Kernel can be compiled with GCC4, boots, USB networking works.
* Matchbox worked, but got removed from repos
* [[MATE]] works
* Some apps might crash the device.
* It uses the 16 bit color mode.

== Enter fastboot ==
* Power + Volume Down buttons (that boots the device into HBOOT, use the volume buttons and power to select Fastboot)
* use TWRP reboot bootloader
* <code>adb reboot bootloader</code>

== Installing ==
* Boot to fastboot
* Install rootfs to the SD card or the internal storage with <code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs</code> (S-OFF needed for the internal storage)
* Run <code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</code>
* Reboot

{{note|Installing to the userdata partition didn't work, tested flashing Matchbox and MATE, MATE was too big.}}
