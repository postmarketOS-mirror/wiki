== Issues ==
* Phone gets stuck somewhere when shutting down
* X11 doesn't work (requires kernel patching)
* Firmware is not packaged (source of the most problems)
* Touchscreen doesn't work (initfs hook gets executed too early)

== How to enter flash mode ==
<code>Power</code> + <code>Volume Down</code> buttons or use <code>adb reboot bootloader</code>

== Installation ==
=== Installation on sdcard ===
<source lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap init # Select motorola-montana device
$ pmbootstrap install --sdcard=/dev/YOURSDCARD # Replace YOURSDCARD with sdcard's blockdevice (example: mmcblk0, don't forget to plug your sdcard in your PC before entering this command!)
$ pmbootstrap flasher boot # To boot kernel without flashing it
</source>
=== Installation on internal memory ===
This is untested, but kubast2 had success with Android Recovery Zip.

== Troubleshooting ==
=== Boot partiiton is not found! ===
This is very strange error which can be fixed by booting in Android with sdcard inserted.
