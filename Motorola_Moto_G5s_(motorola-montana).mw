== How to enter flash mode ==
Power + Volume Down buttons or use `adb reboot-bootloader`

== Installation ==
<!-- I installed the rootfs on a /system partition. Flashing the kernel to the boot partition tested, rootfs flashing.
Only tested recovery zip, unknown if fastboot works because my bootloader doesn't allow flashing, but allows booting and is otherwise unlocked. -->
=== Installation on sdcard ===
<source lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap init # Select motorola-montana device
$ pmbootstrap install --sdcard=/dev/YOURSDCARD # Replace YOURSDCARD with sdcard's blockdevice (example: mmcblk0, don't forget to plug your sdcard in your PC before entering this command!)
$ pmbootstrap flasher boot # To boot kernel without flashing it
</source>
=== Installation on internal memory ===
This is untested, but kubast2 had success with Android Recovery Zip.
