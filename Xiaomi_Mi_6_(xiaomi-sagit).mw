== How to enter flash mode ==
* Power + Volume Down buttons or use TWRP reboot bootloader, or adb reboot bootloader

== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->
Use pmbootstrap flasher.

== Virtual terminal ==
Virtual terminal is broken in downstream, causing early reboot without logs in pstore. [https://gitlab.com/archeYR/pmaports/blob/device/xiaomi-sagit/device/linux-xiaomi-sagit/fix-virtual-terminal.patch This patch] is needed to make virtual terminal working properly.

== Input ==
Touchscreen works well on gnome. All the buttons except for home button (which is is integrated with fingerprint scanner) are working.

== Display ==
Seems to work well. Currently only xfce4 and mate and gnome have been tested.

== USB OTG ==
Tested USB Hub with ethernet adapter, USB Audio device, and HID peripherals. Everything works well.
== Mainline kernel ==

Here's a list of stuff that is currently (Linux 5.6) known to be working (in at least some capacity):

* The kernel itself stays booted (i.e. no random panics) and is "stable"
* UFS internal storage (<code>CONFIG_PHY_QCOM_UFS=y</code>)
* Display (via [https://github.com/JamiKettunen/linux-mainline-oneplus5/commit/704fce760059660aac6f1b236238d461806da34f <code>simplefb</code>] & <code>CONFIG_FB_SIMPLE=y</code>)
* Xorg & Wayland (tested with [https://i.imgur.com/VgsaOtY.jpg MATE] & [https://i.imgur.com/dLItMIm.jpg Weston] respectively)
* Bluetooth (requires <code>crbtfw21.tlv</code> and <code>crnv21.bin</code> blobs from [https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/tree/qca linux-firmware] + a <code>hciconfig hci0 up</code> in userspace)
* Power button ([https://github.com/JamiKettunen/linux-mainline-oneplus5/blob/device-oneplus-cheeseburger/arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/pm8998.dtsi#L41 in DTS])
* USB working ([https://github.com/degdag/mi6-mainline/commit/a11665d313213ad5ab464e74f488465ee053fe38]) (not ; USB_OTG not working yet)


Check the links below for source code.

=== Building ===
It's easiest to build mainline (for pmOS anyway) with [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Mainlining_Guide#pmbootstrap_setup pmbootstrap], so get that setup and remember the install location (in this guide <code>~/pmOS/pmbootstrap</code> is an example).

After you've run through the [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/OnePlus_5_(oneplus-cheeseburger)#Installation installation steps found on this site at least once] please <code>pmbootstrap extract</code> & save the produced downstream <code>boot.img</code> to a known location as we'll reuse the initramfs found inside later.

Next start following the instructions below:

  git clone https://github.com/degdag/mi6-mainline.git
  cd mi6-mainline/
  source ~/pmOS/pmbootstrap/helpers/envkernel.sh     # adjust to match where you've cloned PMB yourself
  make defconfig
  make -j`nproc`

=== Boot image generation ===
Now that the kernel image and DTBs have been built we can assemble a bootable Android-friendly boot.img (assuming you're still in the root of the cloned kernel dir):

  pmbootstrap chroot -- apk add abootimg android-tools mkbootimg dtbtool
  export DEVICE=`pmbootstrap config device | cut -d'-' -f2` WORK=`pmbootstrap config work` PMOS_BOOT_IMG_PATH="~/pmOS/downstream-boot.img"
  export TEMP="$WORK/chroot_native/tmp/mainline/" DTB="$PWD/.output/arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/msm8998-$DEVICE.dtb"
  rm -r "$TEMP"; mkdir -p "$TEMP"
  cat .output/arch/arm64/boot/Image.gz "$DTB" > "$TEMP/Image.gz-dtb"
  cp "$PMOS_BOOT_IMG_PATH" "$TEMP/boot.img"          # replace "$PMOS_BOOT_IMG_PATH" with the known location of a pmOS downstream boot.img
  pmbootstrap chroot -- abootimg -u /tmp/mainline/boot.img -k /tmp/mainline/Image.gz-dtb -c "bootsize=67108864"

At this point you get to choose whether to <code>boot</code> the new kernel image or more "permanently" <code>flash</code> it on the device's boot partition instead ^^

Boot: <code>pmbootstrap chroot -- fastboot boot /tmp/mainline/boot.img</code>

Flash: <code>pmbootstrap chroot -- fastboot flash boot /tmp/mainline/boot.img</code>
