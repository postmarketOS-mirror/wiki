== Installing Manually ==

==== Download pmbootstrap ====
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap.git
</syntaxhighlight>

==== Create a link ====
If the directory <code>~/.local/bin</code> does not already exist, create it with:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ mkdir --parents ~/.local/bin
</syntaxhighlight>

Create a symbolic link in <code>~/.local/bin</code> named <code>pmbootstrap</code>:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ ln -s "$PWD/pmbootstrap/pmbootstrap.py" ~/.local/bin/pmbootstrap
</syntaxhighlight>

==== Test installation ====
To test that pmbootstrap is installed correctly, open a new terminal and run:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap --version
</syntaxhighlight>

If this returns something like <code>pmbootstrap: command not found</code> instead of a version number, ensure that the following lines are in <code>~/.profile</code> (zsh: <code>~/.zprofile</code>): 
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell">
# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
fi
</syntaxhighlight>
Then open a new terminal and try again.

== Tab completion ==
{{note|Make sure you have created and tested the symlink as described above!}}

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion Tab completion] is an optional feature that saves you time by automatically filling in the rest of a command when you press the tab key. You can also see a list of possible commands by double pressing the tab key.

Install [https://argcomplete.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ argcomplete] with:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ pip3 install --user argcomplete
</syntaxhighlight>

Next, do one of the following depending on the shell you use.

==== Bash ====
Add the following line to <code>~/.bashrc</code>:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell">
eval "$(register-python-argcomplete pmbootstrap)"
</syntaxhighlight>

Then reload your configuration by opening a new terminal or by running <code>source ~/.bashrc</code>.

==== Zsh ====
Add the following lines to <code>~/.zshrc</code>:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell">
autoload bashcompinit
bashcompinit
eval "$(register-python-argcomplete pmbootstrap)"
</syntaxhighlight>

Then reload your configuration by opening a new terminal or by running <code>source ~/.zshrc</code>.
