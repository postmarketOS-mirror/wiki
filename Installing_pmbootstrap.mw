== Installing Manually ==

==== Download pmbootstrap ====
 git clone https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap.git

==== Create a link ====

If the directory <code>~/.local/bin</code> does not already exist, create it with
 mkdir --parents ~/.local/bin

Create a symbolic link in <code>~/.local/bin</code> named <code>pmbootstrap</code>
 ln -s "$PWD/pmbootstrap/pmbootstrap.py" ~/.local/bin/pmbootstrap

==== Test installation ====

To test that pmbootstrap is installed correctly, open a new terminal and run
 pmbootstrap --version

If this returns something like <code>pmbootstrap: command not found</code> instead of a version number, ensure that the following lines are in <code>~/.profile</code>, then open a new terminal and try again
 # set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
 if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ] ; then
     PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
 fi

 pip3 install --user argcomplete

Next, do one of the following depending on the shell you use:
