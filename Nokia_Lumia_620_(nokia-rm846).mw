=== Tools ===
You will need  some tools for development:
* [https://www.wpinternals.net/ wpinternals]: This is an open-source tool from an XDA-User. It runs natively on Windows.
* [https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/help/12379/windows-10-mobile-device-recovery-tool-faq Windows Phone Recovery Tool]: This is a proprietary tool from Microsoft. It also runs natively on Windows.
* A tool for flashing images to an SDCard e.g. [https://www.balena.io/etcher/ BalenaEtcher]
* [https://developer.android.com/studio/ ADB & Fastboot] (You do not need the whole Android Studio but the Command Line Tools at the bottom of the page)

=== Backup Data ===
Postmarketos is not ready to use as a daily driver yet. So use a phone you do not need for the development. If you have some data on it, back it up now.

=== Clean Firmware Install ===
Use the Windows Device Recovery Tool to install clean Firmware. This is to avoid errors.
