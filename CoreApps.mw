A set of apps with constant looks across all the apps and can run in lower system without hardware acceleration and optimized for touchscreen.

== Status ==
Apps work smoothly on most devices with a working display, both with and without hardware acceleration.

== Description ==
There are some core features that make applications great to use on mobile devices. Some are listed here.
* All the apps are light with lesser dependencies, use less RAM.
* All the apps are touch-friendly and suitable for phablets and tablets and we are working towards that.
* Apps use the precious vertical screen real estate properly. So, apps work great in small screens.


There are 19 CoreApps and they all listed here with their descriptions.
* CoreActions - A side bar for showing widgets
* CorePins - A bookmarking app.
* CoreArchiver - Archiver to create and extract archives.
* CoreFm - A lightweight file-manager
* CoreGarage - A settings manager.
* CoreHunt - A file finder utility.
* CoreImage - An image viewer.
* CorePad - A document editor.
* CorePaint - A paint app.
* CorePDF - A PDF viewer.
* CorePlayer - A player based on QtAV library. (Not ported because QtAV is not in repo)

Two apps are in development.

<code>$ sudo apk add corefm</code>

== Usages ==

* More usable in horizontal screen rotation.

== Idea ==
* Make package with i3wm + CoreApps as a interface.

== Issues ==

* Some icons are showing discolor. Because of SVG is no rendering correctly.
