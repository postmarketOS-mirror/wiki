== How to enter flash mode ==
Press Volume down on power up.

== Installation ==
Image must be sideloaded with TWRP recovery. Check [[Android Recovery Zip Installation]] for instructions on creating the image.

== Mainline Kernel ==
It has been reported that this device now runs with the mainline kernel: https://github.com/CustomROMs/android_local_manifests_i9300/issues/1#issuecomment-568949705
The report says "I'm able to boot into buildroot with a 5.4 kernel, display, touch, wifi and some other stuff already working. I can run kmscube but I think it's not using the lima driver but software rendering as it's really slow."

XDA forum post about the mainline kernel work being done on this device: https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-note-10-1/general/mainline-n8000-progress-t3964980
