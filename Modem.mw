== Qualcomm Modems ==

On most Qualcomm SoCs the modem is a separate processor which lives next to the main CPU where Linux is running on. It needs to be given firmware by the host processor to start.

The procedure for getting the modem to work is generally the following:
* Package and install the [[Firmware]] of your modem into the file system, generally the <code>mba.*</code> and <code>modem.*</code> files.
* Install the package <code>msm-modem-downstream</code> or <code>msm-modem-mainline</code>, depending on the kernel you are using (and reboot to activate the udev rules and services).
* Install <code>ofono</code> and start it using <code>rc-service ofono start</code>
* You should see signs of your firmware being loaded in the dmesg.
* You can use the [https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/ofono/ofono.git/tree/test ofono test scripts] or <code>ofonoctl</code> to see if the Linux recognized your modem and if it works correctly.

* Note, that for dual SIM (maybe only for DSDS - dual SIM dual standby?) devices you need to follow additional manual steps, otherwise the modem (and ofono) will not recognize your SIM card. See [https://gist.github.com/TravMurav/45a705f210125858ce889b06f90656d9]
