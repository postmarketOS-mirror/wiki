This page is about <code>deviceinfo_dev_touchscreen</code> from the [[deviceinfo]] file.

== How to find the touchscreen device name? ==

{{note|'''Note:''' The <code>deviceinfo_dev_touchscreen</code> property is mostly obsolete - [https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/merge_requests/3709 DirectFB can now automatically detect the touchscreen]. This works only if the touchscreen sets the [https://github.com/libts/tslib/issues/108#issuecomment-342556917 INPUT_PROP_DIRECT] bit to identify the input device as a touchscreen. Setting the property is only necessary if your touchscreen is not automatically detected.}}

=== Initramfs #1 (fastest) ===
* [[Inspecting_the_initramfs|Connect to your initramfs via telnet]]
* Run <code>ls /dev/input</code>
* For each device in there, do the following:
** Run cat /dev/input/$device
** Tap on the screen and see if you get any output
** The device where you get output is the touch screen

=== Initramfs #2 ===
* [[Inspecting_the_initramfs|Connect to your initramfs via telnet]]
* Run <code>ls /dev/input</code>
* Try out one after another:
** Change <code>deviceinfo_dev_touchscreen</code> in your <code>deviceinfo</code>
** Rebuild the deviceinfo package, initramfs and flash:
  pmbootstrap checksum device-wiki-example
  pmbootstrap build --force device-wiki-example
  pmbootstrap initfs # rebuild initramfs
  pmbootstrap flasher boot_kernel

=== Easy method (you don't need to connect) ===
* Turn on your device and open any file manager, for example, Total Commander
* Go to <code>/dev/input</code> directory
* For each device in there, try to remove it one by one.
* When the touch screen stops working, it means that the device you just deleted is the touch screen.
* To fix the touch screen, reboot the device.

=== Flashing system + libinput list-devices ===
Alternatively, run <code>pmbootstrap install</code> and flash the system partition again. Then you can use the program <code>libinput list-devices</code> to get the list of devices - with probably more useful names.

When you have the right device name, put it into your <code>deviceinfo</code> (as outlined above), then re-flash the encrypted system image. It should work now.
