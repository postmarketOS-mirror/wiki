== How to find the touchscreen device name? (initramfs only) ==
* [[Inspecting_the_initramfs|Connect to your initramfs via telnet]]
* Run <code>ls /dev/input</code>
* Try out one after another:
** Change <code>deviceinfo_dev_touchscreen</code> in your <code>deviceinfo</code>
** Rebuild the deviceinfo package, initramfs and flash:
  pmbootstrap checksum device-nokia-rx51
  pmbootstrap build --force device-nokia-rx51
  pmbootstrap initfs # rebuild initramfs
  pmbootstrap flasher boot_kernel


== How to find the touchscreen device name? (flashing system) ==
Alternatively, run <code>pmbootstrap install --no-fde</code> and flash the system partition again. The initramfs will boot through without asking you for a password (because you disabled encryption). Then you can use the program <code>libinput-list-devices</code> to get the list of devices - with probably more useful names.

When you have the right device name, put it into your <code>deviceinfo</code> (as outlined above), then re-flash the encrypted system image. It should work now.
