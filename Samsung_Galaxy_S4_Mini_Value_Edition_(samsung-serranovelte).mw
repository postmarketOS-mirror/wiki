== Installation ==
{{note|'''Note:''' Even though MSM8916 is capable of aarch64, the firmware of this device was never updated with aarch64 support. Therefore, this device can only boot mainline on armv7 at the moment.}}

# Install [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd#readme lk2nd] (alternative bootloader that provides a standard fastboot interface)
# Follow the [[Installation guide]]

{{note|'''Note:''' Enter lk2nd fastboot mode by pressing only Volume Down + Power ('''not''' the Home button). Pressing the Home button additionally will bring you to the Samsung Download mode.}}

== Audio ==
<!-- TODO: Share this between all MSM8916 devices -->
Everything is muted by default and must be enabled through alsaucm. Unfortunately, the tool is not very user-friendly.

 $ alsaucm -i -c msm8916
 set _verb HiFi
 set _enadev <device>

where <code><device></code> is one of <code>Speaker</code>, <code>Earpiece</code>, <code>Headphones</code>, <code>PrimaryMic</code>, <code>HeadsetMic</code> or <code>SecondaryMic</code>.
alsaucm does not track which devices are already enabled, therefore it is possible to produce combinations that won't work properly (e.g. <code>Headphones</code>+<code>Earpiece</code>). To switch between devices, the old device first needs to be re-enabled and then disabled:

 $ alsaucm -i -c msm8916
 set _verb HiFi
 set _enadev OLD
 set _disdev OLD
 set _enadev NEW

{{note|'''Warning:''' alsaucm sets the volume to maximum by default. It is possible to increase the volume even further, however, this may lead to permanent damage to your speaker!}}
