== Installation ==
<source lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs
$ pmbootstrap flasher boot
</source>

== Photos ==

== Notes ==

* The flashlight can be switched on with:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/led\:switch/brightness
</source>
and it can be switched off with:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/led\:switch/brightness
</source>

* The charging LED can be switched on similarly, simply substitute `led\:switch` with `charging`. The charging LED will only blink as of now.

* You can change the screen brightness with:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ echo $brightness > /sys/class/leds/led\:switch/brightness
</source>

== Mainlining ==

Mainlining is in the early stages, based on Junak's msm8953 kernel. Source for the kernel is available here:

https://github.com/scarface-one/linux-msm8953

{{note|1=Only boots on XT1686, the Indian variant, with board_id = <0x46, 0x83a0>. Porting to other variants of potter should be trivial}}
{{note|1=Lk2nd is a hard dependency, without it the mainline kernel will not boot. You can get lk2nd for potter from here: https://github.com/scarface-one/lk2nd}}

What works:

* Display

:* Only Boe panel works

:* Need test device for Tianma panel, along with way to select panel at boot

:* Using labibb regulator driver from mainline patchworks: 1239224

:* Brightness control works, but doesn't use the qcom-wled backlights, needs further investigation

* GPU (DRM and FB) 

:* requires proprietary firmware blobs, can be extracted from Android, or can be downloaded from firmware repositories

:* Sometimes crashes on resume after suspend

* SSH and Telnet via USB 

:* Low power mode on USB doesn't work, but apparently never worked on any kernel ever on msm8953 devices.

:* USB used to be slow and ssh/telnet were unresponsive, until lpm was disabled.

* Touchscreen

:* Synaptics 3203B, works using mainline RMI4 driver

* NFC

:* Not tested, but driver loads and binds correctly, so it might work

* LEDs

:* Front charging LED works (Qualcomm ATC-LED)

* Battery (qcom-fg/qpnp-fg)

:* Reports voltage, capacity, temperature, current, battery data and energy

:* Needs to deliver other data like and battery details

:* 2 different battery suppliers, need a way to probe and select

* Wifi

:* Only 2.4GHz works, mainline wcnss driver has a bug that prevents 5GHz networks from appearing

* Bluetooth

:* Works, even audio over bluetooth, but needs pulseaudio-bluez, bluez-alsa and bluez-hcd2hci to be installed

* Storage

:* MMC works as expected

:* SD Card works, but some (minor) issue with cd-gpios needs to be fixed for proper card detection. Otherwise works as expected.

* Modem

:* Boots

:* Doesn't actually work, seems to use a different way to talk to userspace than other currently supported qcom modems

* ADSP

:* Boots

:* Useless without soundcard drivers

Anything that isn't listed above can be assumed to not work.
