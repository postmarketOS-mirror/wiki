== Installation ==
<source lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs
$ pmbootstrap flasher boot
</source>

== Photos ==

== Notes ==

* The flashlight can be switched on with:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/led\:switch/brightness
</source>
and it can be switched off with:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/led\:switch/brightness
</source>

* The charging LED can be switched on similarly, simply substitute `led\:switch` with `charging`. The charging LED will only blink as of now.

* You can change the screen brightness with:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ echo $brightness > /sys/class/leds/led\:switch/brightness
</source>

== Mainlining ==

Mainlining is in the early stages, based on Junak's msm8953 kernel. Source for the kernel is available here:

https://github.com/scarface-one/linux-msm8953

{{note|1=Only boots on XT1686, the Indian variant, with board_id = <0x46, 0x83a0>. Porting to other variants of potter should be trivial}}
{{note|1=Lk2nd is a hard dependency, without it the mainline kernel will not boot. You can get lk2nd for potter from here: https://github.com/scarface-one/lk2nd}}

What works:

* Display

:* Only Boe panel works

:* Need test device for Tianma panel, along with way to select panel at boot

:* Using labibb regulator driver from mainline patchworks: 1239224

:* Brightness control works, but doesn't use the qcom-wled backlights, needs further investigation

* GPU (DRM and FB) 

:* requires proprietary firmware blobs, can be extracted from Android, or can be downloaded from firmware repositories

:* Sometimes crashes on resume after suspend

* SSH and Telnet via USB 

:* Sometime you might get stuck with no prompt, or a password prompt, or the connection may seem to lag. No fix has been found yet, but a temporary workaround is to run <code>ping 172.16.42.1</code> in another terminal, while using ssh or telnet.

:* Adding <code>trace_event=dwc3 tp_printk=1</code> to the kernel boot args seems to completely mitigate the issue

* Touchscreen

:* Synaptics 3203B, works using mainline RMI4 driver

:* Uses a hack to keep <code>gpio64</code> on, should be fixed

* NFC

:* Not tested, but driver loads and binds correctly, so it might work

* LEDs

:* Front charging LED works (Qualcomm ATC-LED)

* Battery

:* Reports voltage, capacity, temperature, energy

:* Needs to deliver other data like current and battery details

:* Driver needs testing and cleaning up.

:* 2 different battery suppliers, need a way to probe and select

Anything that isn't listed above can be assumed to not work.
