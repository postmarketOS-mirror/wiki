== Prerequisites ==
* '''rooted''' phone
* microSD card

== Installation ==
{{note|The only method tested assumes flashing <code>boot.img</code> to the <code>recovery</code> partition and <code>rootfs</code> to the microSD card}}
<code>fastboot</code> reported to be locked on this phone, you will need to flash everything from the KaiOS directly instead
* install <code>rootfs</code> to the microSD with <code>pmbootstrap install --sdcard=/dev/sdX</code>
* put the card into the phone and boot it to the KaiOS
* export <code>boot.img</code> to the <code>/tmp</code> on your host machine: <code>pmbootstrap export</code>
* push <code>boot.img</code> to the <code>/sdcard</code>: <code>adb push /tmp/postmarketOS-export/boot.img-nokia-beatles /sdcard/</code>
* flash <code>recovery</code> partition: <code>adb shell "dd if=/sdcard/boot.img-nokia-beatles of=/dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/recovery bs=2048"</code>
* reboot to the freshly flashed pmOS: <code>adb reboot recovery</code>

You will be able to boot to pmOS by turning on the phone while holding the <code>Volume Up</code> button.
