This page explains how to connect to your device when it has booted to the [[Initramfs-development|initramfs]] by installing the so-called [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/master/aports/main/postmarketos-mkinitfs-hook-usb-shell/20-usb-shell.sh usb-shell hook]. This is useful if you want to know more about the [[boot process]], simply inspect the initramfs or you want to debug why something doesn't work.

'''NOTE: This is considered a security hole. Only use it for debugging, and uninstall the usb-shell hook afterwards'''

By default, initramfs launchs a telnet daemon listening on <code>:23</code> waiting for your partition password.

It is possible to enable a second telnet daemon on <code>:24</code> that gives you a shell this way:

<pre class="shell">./pmbootstrap.py initfs hook_add usb-shell
./pmbootstrap.py install</pre>
After reflashing the kernel or booting with the new initramfs image, you should be able to connect to the new telnet instance.
