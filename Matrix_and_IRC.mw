If you want to talk to other people working on/with postmarketOS you can do so either:

Join Matrix group

[[https://matrix.to/#/#postmarketos:disroot.org|'''#postmarketos:disroot.org''']]

Or IRC:

'''#postmarketos on freenode'''

Matrix &amp; IRC are bridged.

''If you don't know which one to use, use the Matrix group, because it doesn't require a bouncer to receive all messages all the time.''

There is also an off-topic room available at [[https://matrix.to/#/#postmarketos-offtopic:disroot.org|'''#postmarketos-offtopic:disroot.org''']] for Matrix users and '''##postmarketos-offtopic''' at Freenode for IRC users.

<blockquote>Please use the [https://reddit.com/r/postmarketos reddit page] for general discussions, as the matrix &amp; IRC are primarily focused on porting / development help &amp; discussions.
</blockquote>
