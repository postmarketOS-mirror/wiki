== How to enter flash mode ==
You have to have your bootloader unlocked through this method: https://forum.xda-developers.com/hd8-hd10/orig-development/unlock-fire-hd-10-2017-suez-t3913639

Entering fastboot through normal methods will not work as we need to access the hacked bootloader. Normal fastboot doesn't let us flash in the required partitions.

Simply hold volume up while powering it up to access TWRP. From TWRP you can reboot into the hacked bootloader as needed.

== Installation ==
From TWRP, you have access to ADB sideload, which you can use to install the recovery zip exported from pmbootstrap, or you can reboot into the hacked bootloader to access fastboot. You have to take the following things into consideration:

- fastboot has a limit on the filesize of files to be flashed. rootfs cannot be flashed from fastboot. Only boot can be flashed. To flash rootfs, use ADB sideload.

- Since the unlocking of the bootloader modified the paritition scheme of the device, to flash into it, you have to execute: fastboot flash boot_x FILE_TO_BE_FLASHED

- The default recovery zip generated by pmbootstrap flashes boot.img into the paritition named 'boot'. This won't work as the hacked bootloader resides there. Instead, we have to unpack the zip file, modify line 5 of chroot/install_options and lines 69 and 70 of chroot/bin/pmos_install_functions to replace boot by boot_x. Repack the zip file afterwards and it should be good to go.
