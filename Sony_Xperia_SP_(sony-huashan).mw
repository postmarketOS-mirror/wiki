== How to enter flash mode ==

=== From adb ===

Enter the command `adb reboot bootloader`

=== From Android with custom rom ===

The power menu might have a "Reboot to bootloader option"

=== With the device off ===

Press the {{Button|Volume Up}} button, then plug in the USB cable. The LED bar should light up blue

== What works ==
* Compiles
* Boots up
* Weston

== What does not work ==

* Wifi
* Bt
* Audio

== Boot image format ==

I used [https://github.com/AdrianDC/android_boot_bridge Android boot bridge's release zip] to "skip" the bootimg_analyze step, as the releases include a "template boot.img".

This device uses ELF image but also adds RPM file to the mix which at the end builds into dt file in boot image. The ELF image support Merge Request does still not support it but i will work on it to get it supported.
For now boot image has to be generated manually with mkelf.
