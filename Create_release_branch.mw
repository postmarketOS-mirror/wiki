This is relevant for maintaining the repository only, regular users will not need this guide.

== Creating a new release branch ==
=== Checklist ===
Creating a new release branch, like "v20.05":

* <code>git checkout -b v20.05 master</code>
* <code>git push</code>
* protect the new release branch in gitlab, so nobody can force-push to it
* remove channels.cfg (should only be in master)
* adjust channel in pmaports.cfg
* replace "master" in .gitlab-ci.yml ([https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/commit/3db21d5852291061eac005436b81cfb9a6d93cc3 example])
* remove packages:
** device/testing
** cross/*-armhf, cross/*-x86
** unused firmware packages (see script below)
* run <code>pmbootstrap aportgen</code> for packages in cross
* add the new branch to master's channels.cfg
* bpo
** add the branch to bpo's config, for x86_64 only
** wait until all packages for x86_64 are built and published, fix packages as necessary
** after x86_64 is published, activate more arches (if you activate them before, the builds will fail due to missing cross compilers!)

=== Remove unused firmware packages ===

After removing <code>device/testing/*</code>, the related firmware packages should be removed as well. This script adds them for removal, read it, run it, then do <code>git status</code> and <code>git commit</code>.

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell">
#!/bin/sh -e
PMAPORTS=~/code/pmaports

# $1: pkgname
firmware_mentioned_anywhere() {
	local pkgname="$1"

	cd "$PMAPORTS"
	for dir in *; do
		[ -d "$dir" ] || continue
		[ "$dir" = "firmware" ] && continue
		
		git -C "$dir" grep -q "$pkgname" && return 0
	done
	return 1
}

cd "$PMAPORTS/firmware"
for i in *; do
	if firmware_mentioned_anywhere "$i"; then
		echo "# $i was found"
	else
		git rm -r "$PMAPORTS/firmware/$i"
	fi
done
echo "# done"
</syntaxhighlight>

== Maintenance ==

=== Cherry-picking commits from master ===

* Use <code>git cherry-pick -x ffffffff</code> (insert commit to cherry pick accordingly). The <code>-x</code> will add a <code>(cherry picked from commit ffffffff)</code> line to the commit message.
* Cherry picked commits shall not be squashed, then it's hard to understand which commits were already picked and which were not.
* If git reports conflicts, resolve them.
** If you have cherry-picked a commit, that has touched a lot of devices that don't exist in the stable branch, then you can use <code>git rm $(git status | grep "deleted by us" | cut -d ':' -f 2)</code>.
** Look at the <code>git diff</code> to make sure that the result is as expected.
* If it's something non-trivial, then make a merge request for the cherry-picked commits so we see that it was done correctly, it builds and that we may test the packages before merging.
