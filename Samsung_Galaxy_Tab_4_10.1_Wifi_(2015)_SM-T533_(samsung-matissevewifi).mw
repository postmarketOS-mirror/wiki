== How to enter Odin flash mode ==

* Hold <code>Power</code> + <code>Volume Down</code> + <code>Home</code> while powering up the device.
* Press <code>Volume Up</code> to enable flashing.

This device uses Odin. In order to be able to flash on it you need to install <code>heimdall</code>.
On ArchLinux this package in present in the repos.

The command to flash an image is:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash" line='line'>
heimdall flash  --<partition_name> <your .img file>
</syntaxhighlight>

== Description ==

The device is based on the apq8016 variant of the msm8916 SoC that is beeing mainlined [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/linux here]. It means that it is in the process of beeing supported as is by the upstream Linux kernel.

== Milestones ==
This presents the important steps that have been achieved toward mainlining this device:
# [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd/pull/13 bootloader]
# [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/linux/pull/60 usb/network]
# [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/linux/pull/61 WiFi/BT]
# [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/merge_requests/1030 device package]
# [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/linux/pull/62 Display]
# [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/linux/pull/63 buttons]

== TODO ==
* Sound
* Screen: remove backlight hack
* Battery management
