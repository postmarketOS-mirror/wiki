== Status ==
According to MartijnBraam, it's working quite well on the N900. It does not make sense to run this interface on a device without a hardware keyboard, because it is a tiling window manager. Since the N900 keyboard does not provide the same keys, as a regular keyboard does, the N900 device package has its own i3 config. It is easy to add such a config to your device as well, just look at how it's done in <code>device-nokia-n900</code>, modify your device package accordingly and make a pull request.

== Installation ==
Run <code>pmbootstrap init</code> and choose <code>i3wm</code> in the interface section.

Currently this installs <code>lxdm</code> as display manager (a common display manager is planned, see [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/issues/88 gitlab issue 88]). When booting for the first time, you need to select i3 in the top left dropdown, where it allows you to choose the session.

== Ideas ==
* How about a wallpaper for the N900 with i3wm, that is based on the postmarketOS wallpaper, but shows the keybindings on the desktop?
