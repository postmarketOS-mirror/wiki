As a part of [https://www.papdan.com Melbourne web development] team, I get asked a lot about why a website is not generating leads or that a website doesn’t work the way we want it to. I am not a web developer but I am a part of their team, so I asked one of my friends from the team about this. He gave me a very detailed explanation but I have summed it up into several parts in this article. His explanation may be detailed, but it is actually very simple to understand. Need to understand why your website is not generating leads? Keep reading this article to find out!

So you’ve built a cool website with all the bells and whistles, you work hard to build traffic and get people to look at your offers but all they do is bounce off and buy from your competitor? Don’t worry; you will know the reasons and factors once you finish reading this article.

==You have probably created confusing call-to-actions==
When we investigate pages with low conversion rates, our first port of call is analyzing calls to action (CTA). One common thing we have found when analyzing those pages is that there are too many CTAs on a single landing page. The general rule for making great website with high conversion rate is that there is only one CTA necessary per page. If you want a visitor to make a purchase, your CTA is “buy now.” Therefore, stick to the single CTA rule and you’ll see that the landing page starts generating leads.

==Your CTAs are too weak or vague==
One of the popular reasons your website is not generating leads is that you use weak or vague CTAs. How many times have you seen an important B2B landing page where the lead capture form has an uninspiring grey action button reading “Submit”? Not only does this word has a subconsciously negative connotation, it is also very passive and unexciting. Like, submit what? What can your visitors gain from submitting something that is not clear? It should be simple but clear like this; the button should be active and tell the visitor exactly what he needs to do. If it’s a purchase, it should read “buy now”. If it’s an ebook, it should read “download your free copy” and so on.

==Your website has poor design and content==
Content and web design have a big role in generating more leads. Why? Put yourself in your visitors’ shoes; if you are visiting a website that has confusing content that is not even answering your questions as to why you should buy their products (Well, that’s the main reason why we are visiting a business website; to find the information about their products and their business), would you even consider buying their products? No, right? On the other hand, if you are visiting a website and you can’t even read the content because of poor or difficult designs, would you even continue trying so hard to read what is inside the website? Would you even continue browsing the page if you cannot click on the right button because of unclear navigation? No, right? That’s why the website fails and you don’t want that to happen to your website as well.

Also, one of the most important parts to remember when building a website is to focus on and prioritize responsiveness on mobile devices. In this day and age, people use mobile devices more often to browse a website than their personal computer because it is easier that way and it can be done on the go. The competition in most niches are so strong; and a visitor who hasn’t been happy with his user experience on a mobile device will not make the effort of revisiting the site on a desktop device. Instead, they will check a competitor’s website. Therefore, keep in mind that in order for your website to generate more leads, you need to pay attention to every details of your website including its functionality and responsiveness when accessed through mobile devices. When you have this mindset, your business is on the right path.
