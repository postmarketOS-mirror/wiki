None

== What works ==

* The kernel compiles

* Flashing finishes without error

== What does not work ==

* After trying to boot, the device is stuck at the Honor branding/fastboot screen
** When using fastboot mode, fastboot isn't able to connect to the device after it booted. This might possibly indicate that something is happening and graphics are not working, but it probably means that it doesn't boot at all.

* ???

== How to enter flash mode ==

Hold volume down plus power at the same time. If your device is unlocked already, it will show "device unlocked" at the bottom. To unlock the bootloader (which also deletes all data on your device!), please refer to [https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/kiwi/install#unlocking-the-bootloader this section on the LineageOS installation guide].

== Installation ==

# Please follow the [[Installation guide]], but use <syntaxhighlight lang="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap.git device-huawei-kiwi</syntaxhighlight> in order to clone this device's branch.
# Generate installation files with <syntaxhighlight lang="bash">$ ./pmbootstrap.py install</syntaxhighlight>If you prefer to install with TWRP, append <syntaxhighlight lang="bash"> --android-recovery-zip</syntaxhighlight>
# Follow the steps displayed at the end of output the previous command to finally flash postmarketOS.
