None

== What works ==

* The kernel compiles

== What does not work ==

* The recovery zip that can be generated fails because boot.img is not found. It may also happen to be the case that device tree images are not appended correctly. ([https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/750 relevant issue #750])

* ??? (device doesn't boot so no additional problems could be found)

== How to enter flash mode ==

Hold volume down plus power at the same time. If your device is unlocked already, it will show "device unlocked" at the bottom. To unlock the bootloader (which also deletes all data on your device!), please refer to [https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/kiwi/install#unlocking-the-bootloader this section on the LineageOS installation guide].

== Installation ==

You can not install postmarketOS on this device yet because something is not quite right – see above.

== Photos ==

Nothing to show.
