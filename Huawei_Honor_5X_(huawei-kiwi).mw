None

== What works ==

* The kernel compiles

* Flashing finishes without error

== What does not work ==

* After trying to boot, the device is stuck at the Honor branding/fastboot screen
** When using fastboot mode, fastboot isn't able to connect to the device after it booted. This might possibly indicate that something is happening and graphics are not working, but it probably means that it doesn't boot at all.

* ???

== How to enter flash mode ==

Hold {{Button|Volume Down}} + {{Button|Power}} at the same time.

===Unlocking the bootloader===

If you forgot whether your device is unlocked already, check whether it displays "device unlocked" at the bottom in flash mode.

'''Huawei stopped distributing unlock codes.''' Tutorials telling you to go to some Huawei website, log in with a Huawei ID and sign the unlocking agreement to get a code will no longer work.

Some services claim to be able to unlock this device, but they charge money for it (e. g. DC-Unlocker charges 4€). Be careful and try to do research before giving any of these services your money.

== Installation ==

# Please follow the [[Installation guide]], but use <syntaxhighlight lang="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap.git device-huawei-kiwi</syntaxhighlight> in order to clone this device's branch.
# Generate installation files with <syntaxhighlight lang="bash">$ ./pmbootstrap.py install</syntaxhighlight>If you prefer to install with TWRP, append <syntaxhighlight lang="bash"> --android-recovery-zip</syntaxhighlight>
# Follow the steps displayed at the end of output the previous command to finally flash postmarketOS.
