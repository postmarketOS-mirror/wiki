=== What works ===

* Compiling the kernel
* Flashing pmos + kernel

'''Current status''': There is currently no way to telnet into the device: 'lsusb' shows nothing after rebooting.

'''What i've tried''':

* The security hole on [[Inspecting the initramfs]]
* Flashing manually with fastboot command
* Everything on [[Boot process]] (doesn't work obviously as even lsusb does not recognize my device)
