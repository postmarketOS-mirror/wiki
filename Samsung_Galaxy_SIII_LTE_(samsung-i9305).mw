'''So far, what works for samsung-i9305 (Galaxy SIII LTE version) also works for the samsung-i9300 (Galaxy SIII international GSM version without LTE).  (Neither of these SIII models should be confused with the North American SIII models, which require OS builds.)'''

== How to enter flash mode ==

* Hold power + Home + volume down
* When prompted, release all buttons and press volume up

== Installation ==

Set phone to ODIN mode

  1. Turn off phone
  2. Connect USB cable
  3. Hold VOLUME_DOWN + HOME + POWER until you get Warning!! screen
  4. Push VOLUME_UP to continue to ODIN mode screen

At this point you can follow the [[Installation guide | general installation guide]]. 
Installation to the system is not yet supported for the device, so make sure to install postmarketOS to the sdcard. Also be sure to disable FDE (<code>--no-fde</code>) as osk-sdl is not yet supported for this device, and enabling it would require you to telnet into the device to unlock it.

== Wifi ==

{{Todo|Make sure it works with NetworkManager and if it doesn't work out of the box replace the instructions here for NetworkManager specific ones}}

To get the wifi working, you'll need to modify the wpa_supplicant confg
  
  # If this is not done, wpa_supplicant launches itself with -ip2p0
  $ echo 'wpa_supplicant_args="-iwlan0 -Dwext"' | sudo tee /etc/conf.d/wpa_supplicant
  $ sudo wpa_passphrase $YOUR_SSID > /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
  $ /etc/init.d/wpa_supplicant restart
 
Write the following file to <source>/etc/network/interfaces</source>

  auto lo 
  iface lo inet loopback   
  auto wlan0 
  iface wlan0 inet dhcp

Restart the network to verify it's working

  $ /etc/init.d/networking restart

Set it to start on boot

  $ sudo rc-update add wpa_supplicant boot
  $ sudo rc-update add networking default

Reboot and you should be connected on boot.

== Mainline Kernel ==
There is currently no mainline kernel available but it should be possible to mainline this device. Have a look at [http://blog.forkwhiletrue.me/pages/midas-mainline/ Midas on Mainline] for work on mainlining very similar devices.
Replicant is also interested in mainlining this device and replacing the bootloader with u-boot and would like to collaborate with us [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1219#issuecomment-395876420].
