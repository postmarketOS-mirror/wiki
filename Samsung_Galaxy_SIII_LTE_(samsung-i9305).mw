== What works ==

* '''So far, what works for samsung-i9305 (Galaxy SIII LTE version) also works for the samsung-i9300 (Galaxy SIII international GSM version without LTE).  (Neither of these SIII models should be confused with the North American SIII models, which require OS builds.)'''

* Installation to sdcard (<code>pmbootstrap install --sdcard=/dev/mmcblk...</code>)
* Touchscreen
* Weston (only on SD card)
* XWayland
* Wifi
* osk-sdl

== What does not work ==

* The rest

== How to enter flash mode ==

* Hold power + Home + volume down
* When prompted, release all buttons and press volume up

== Installation ==

<source lang="shell">$ ./pmbootstrap.py init</source>

Install to sdcard

<source lang="shell">
# Replace /dev/mmcblk with your actual sdcard device
$ ./pmbootstrap.py install --sdcard=/dev/mmcblk
</source>

== Flashing ==

- Set phone to ODIN mode

  1. Turn off phone
  2. Connect USB cable
  3. Hold VOLUME_DOWN + HOME + POWER until you get Warning!! screen
  4. Push VOLUME_UP to continue to ODIN mode screen

- Build and flash the kernel

  $ ./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_kernel

- If flashing fails, try plugging the device into a USB 2.0 port.

== Boot ==

Once postmarketOS is installed on the sdcard and the kernel is flashed, you need telnet to unlock the root partition
  
  $ telnet 172.16.42.1
  Trying 172.16.42.1...
  Connected to 172.16.42.1.
  Escape character is '^]'.

  Enter passphrase for /dev/mapper/mmcblk1p2:

Then you can SSH into the device.

  $ ssh user@172.16.42.1

== Wifi == 

To get the wifi working, you'll need to modify the wpa_supplicant confg
  
  # If this is not done, wpa_supplicant launches itself with -ip2p0
  $ echo 'wpa_supplicant_args="-iwlan0 -Dwext"' | sudo tee /etc/conf.d/wpa_supplicant
  $ sudo wpa_passphrase $YOUR_SSID > /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
  $ /etc/init.d/wpa_supplicant restart
 
Write the following file to <source>/etc/network/interfaces</source>

  auto lo 
  iface lo inet loopback   
  auto wlan0 
  iface wlan0 inet dhcp

Restart the network to verify it's working

  $ /etc/init.d/networking restart

Set it to start on boot

  $ sudo rc-update add wpa_supplicant boot
  $ sudo rc-update add networking default

Reboot and you should be connected on boot.

== Mainline Kernel ==
There is currently no mainline kernel available but it should be possible to mainline this device. Have a look at [http://blog.forkwhiletrue.me/pages/midas-mainline/ Midas on Mainline] for work on mainlining very similar devices.
Replicant is also interested in mainlining this device and replacing the bootloader with u-boot and would like to collaborate with us [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1219#issuecomment-395876420].
