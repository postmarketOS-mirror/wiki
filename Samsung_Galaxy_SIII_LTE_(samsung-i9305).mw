'''So far, what works for samsung-i9305 (Galaxy SIII LTE version) also works for the samsung-i9300 (Galaxy SIII international GSM version without LTE).  (Neither of these SIII models should be confused with the North American SIII models, which require OS builds.)'''

== How to enter flash mode ==

* Hold power + Home + volume down
* When prompted, release all buttons and press volume up

== Installation ==

Set phone to ODIN mode

  1. Turn off phone
  2. Connect USB cable
  3. Hold VOLUME_DOWN + HOME + POWER until you get Warning!! screen
  4. Push VOLUME_UP to continue to ODIN mode screen

At this point you can follow the [[Installation guide | general installation guide]]. 
Installation to the system is not yet supported for the device, so make sure to install postmarketOS to the sdcard. Also be sure to not enable FDE as osk-sdl is not yet supported for this device, and enabling it would require you to telnet into the device to unlock it.

== Wifi ==

To get the wifi working, you'll need to modify the wpa_supplicant configuration. If this is not done, wpa_supplicant starts with -ip2p0 which is not supported on our device.

  $ echo 'wpa_supplicant_args="-iwlan0 -Dwext"' | sudo tee /etc/conf.d/wpa_supplicant
 
Write the following file to <source>/etc/network/interfaces</source>

  auto lo 
  iface lo inet loopback   
  auto wlan0 
  iface wlan0 inet dhcp

To connect using NetworkManger you will need to change the default DHCP client from the NetworkManager internal DHCP client to dhclient (you will need to specify the additional package at install with pmbootstrap or apk add dhclient if you have a connection) by creating <source>/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/dhcp-client.conf</source> and adding
  
  [main]
  dhcp=dhclient

Start the networkmanger service and restart networking service

  $ sudo rc-service networkmanger start
  $ sudo rc-service networking restart

Search for available WiFi networks and connect to network

  $ sudo nmcli device wifi list ifname wlan0
  $ sudo nmcli device wifi connect "$SSID" password "$PASSWORD" ifname wlan0

Set services to start

  $ sudo rc-update add wpa_supplicant boot
  $ sudo rc-update add networking default
  $ sudo rc-update add networkmanager default

Reboot and you should be connected on boot.

You may also connect directly using wpa_supplicant forgoing NetworkManager. Please note this method will not automatically reconnect to WiFi if you loose connection

 $ wpa_passphrase YOUR_SSID YOUR_PASSPHRASE | sudo tee /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
 $ sudo rc-service wpa_supplicant restart


== Mainline Kernel ==
The mainline kernel now has some support for the Samsung Galaxy SIII LTE (i9305):

Upstream dts: [https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/arch/arm/boot/dts/exynos4412-i9305.dts exynos4412-i9305.dts]

Upstream status: [http://blog.forkwhiletrue.me/pages/midas-mainline/ Midas on Mainline].

Note that [https://github.com/fourkbomb/linux/commit/2a6027178ae40c1d3baa965fe21b19cbf09493ce a patch is required] to make it work with the stock samsung bootloader.

forkbomb from LineageOS got mainline u-boot running on this device:
[https://blog.forkwhiletrue.me/posts/an-almost-fully-libre-galaxy-s3/]

Replicant has this device booting with mainline Linux and almost mainline U-Boot with only the need for a few patches on top and would like to collaborate with us [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1219#issuecomment-395876420]

The Qualcomm Gobi MDM9615 Modem seems to have mainline kernel support as well: [https://redmine.replicant.us/projects/replicant/wiki/GalaxyS3I9305#Hardware-table]

Replicant and LineageOS successfully got the Lima driver for Mesa working on Mali when using mainline linux: [http://www.belg.in/replicant_9.webm video] [https://github.com/CustomROMs/android_local_manifests_i9300/issues/1#issuecomment-532308101 success announcement]
