__NOTOC__
<code>channels.cfg</code> is in the master branch of [[pmaports.git]] and maps postmarketOS ''pmaports'' branches to Alpine Linux ''aports'' branches for each release channel.

=== Example ===
<source lang="ini">
# Reference: https://postmarketos.org/channels.cfg
[channels.cfg]
recommended=edge

[edge]
description=Rolling release channel
branch_pmaports=master
branch_aports=master
mirrordir_alpine=edge

[stable]
description=Stable release channel (first beta v20.05, does not have many devices yet)
branch_pmaports=v20.05
branch_aports=3.11-stable
mirrordir_alpine=v3.11
</source>

| What pmbootstrap will recommend to install for new users. Initially this will be edge, until stable is ready, then we switch to stable.

==== edge, stable, stable-next, legacy ====
Channel sections, for which it will be possible to install postmarketOS. <code>edge</code> and <code>stable</code> will always be present, <code>stable-next</code> and <code>legacy</code> only during transition phases from one release to the next one.

=== Location ===
pmbootstrap reads the file from the master/origin branch of pmaports.git. This way, it will always use the latest fetched version, even if the last checked out master branch (master without the origin/ infront) is not up-to-date. This is likely to happen if a release branch was checked out, as a <code>git pull</code> would then only update the reference from the release branch related to origin's release branch, master's reference would not change.

Release branches do ''not'' have a copy of the file, this would just require us to needlessly keep them all in sync.

View it with:

<source lang="shell-session">
$ cd $(pmbootstrap config aports) # change directory to local checkout of pmaports.git
$ git show origin/master:channels.cfg
</source>

For development and testing, it is possible to override the path with <code>--config-channels</code>:

<source lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap --config-channels /tmp/channels.cfg status
</source>
