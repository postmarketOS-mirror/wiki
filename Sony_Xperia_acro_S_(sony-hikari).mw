== What works ==
Nothing so far.

== What does not work ==

Booting.

Unfortunately this device uses a non-standard ELF format boot.img file that is not supported by postmarketOS (yet):
<code>
% file boot.img
boot.img: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1 (ARM), statically linked, corrupted section header size
</code>

== How to enter flash mode ==
Power off the device. Hold Volume Up as you plug the USB cable into the device.

== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->

Follow [https://developer.sony.com/develop/open-devices/get-started/unlock-bootloader Sony's instructions to unlock the bootloader].
