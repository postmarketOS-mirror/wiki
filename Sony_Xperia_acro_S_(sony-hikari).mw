== What works ==

This device uses a non-standard ELF format boot.img file that is not supported by postmarketOS (yet):
 % file boot.img
 boot.img: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1 (ARM), statically linked, corrupted section header size

[[User:Intgr|intgr]] has a working hacked postmarketOS toolchain for building compatible boot.img files.

== What does not work ==

Booting.

==== Downstream kernels ====
After trying out tens of different combinations of kernel sources from the web, I couldn't find any that get as far as initramfs.

The best sources found manage to initialize the display backlight and then crash pretty late in the initialization process with error: [https://gist.github.com/intgr/0aea53457cc7ae4edfaa01cf50807cb7 (see dmesg)]

 BUG: Bad page state in process swapper/0  pfn:5dcba

==== Mainline kernel ====
No peripherals supported yet, but <code>/dev/last_kmsg</code> can be extracted with a binary kernel (e.g. TWRP). Sadly the boot process appears to hang after executing <code>/init</code>: [https://gist.github.com/intgr/cc5b4e606846e33d6415694084f4aba1 (see dmesg)]

== How to enter flash mode ==
Power off the device. Hold Volume Up as you plug the USB cable into the device.

Alternatively, perform a hard reset by holding Power and Volume Up buttons. When the device vibrates, release the Power button *first*, and it will boot into fastboot loader.

== Installation ==
Follow [https://developer.sony.com/develop/open-devices/get-started/unlock-bootloader Sony's instructions to unlock the bootloader].
