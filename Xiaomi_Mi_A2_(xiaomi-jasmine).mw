== How to enter flash mode ==
=== Bootloader Unlocking ===
Because this device is an Android One device, it can be unlocked using <code>fastboot oem unlock</code> from fastboot mode.

=== Recovery mode ===
* Turn the device off (or restart also works)
* Hold volume+ button and power button
* Once you feel vibration and phone turns on, release power button
* Keep holding volume+ until you get to recovery.

=== Flashing (Download, Fastboot) mode ===
* Same as recovery, but this time hold the volume- and power keys.

== Installation ==
