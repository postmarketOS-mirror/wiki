This is a command line based user interface developed first for the Geeksphone Keon and later for several other Android devices. It is really just a collection of simple bash scripts to try and replicate the common features on a phone such as calling, answering, texting, contacts, calendar, note taking, etc.

For postmarketOS shelli is combined with gesture recognition software to provide for a non-UI alternative which uses the touch screen and the linux framebuffer console.

=== Status ===
Initial packaging is in the works at https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/merge_requests/397.

Only known to work on Nexus 5. Some changes would be needed for how big the screen is and which event device is the touchscreen.

A short description and demo is available here: https://gitlab.com/unrznbl/gesture/wikis/gesture---handwriting-for-linux-touchscreens

=== Known Issues ===
I am using `echo "mem" > /sys/power/state` to suspend-to-ram when the power button is pressed. There may be an issue with this strategy. Maybe has something to do with kernel/irqs/watchdog not being fed? See dmesg output at time of failure: https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/merge_requests/265#note_150745636.

* waking up sometimes takes a second or two so be patient. Sometimes the gesture recognition may not be responsive after wake-up. Press the power button again twice to suspend/wake-up and it usually works again.

* tty may freeze when screen is left on for a while. It seems about after 5 minutes this may occur. Press the power button twice to suspend/wake-up to workaround.

Battery capacity reporting is broken. It seems that `/sys/class/power_supply/battery/capacity` is not reporting a percentage but a value that ranges from 0 to around 35,000. Maybe a kernel fix is needed?
