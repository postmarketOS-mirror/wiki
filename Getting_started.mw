== Users ==
Currently, postmarketOS is still in heavy development, so it's not quite usable for most users. If you're an early adopter, or a tinkerer please checkout the next section below.

For devices that will allow ease of use to play with, it is recommended that you get a [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/PINE64_PinePhone_(pine64-pinephone) PinePhone] (Mobile) or a [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_4 Raspberry Pi 4] (single board computer) to use, as their open nature has enabled more stability than other hacked devices

== Tinkerers ==

* It seems that every display environment (such as XFCE4) is using Lightdm
* It is recommended you install [[CoreApps]][https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/CoreApps] using <code>sudo apk add corefm</code> after getting a working install
