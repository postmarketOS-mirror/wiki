If you're an early adopter looking for a more stable device to get familiar with postmarketOS, it is recommended that you get a [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/PINE64_PinePhone_(pine64-pinephone) PinePhone] (Mobile) or a [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_4 Raspberry Pi 4] (single board computer) to use, as their open nature has enabled more stability than other hacked devices

== Tinkerers/Hackers ==

* It seems that every display environment (such as XFCE4) is using Lightdm
* It is recommended you install [[CoreApps]] using <code>sudo apk add corefm</code> after getting a working install

We recommend against using closed source proprietary software such as Android applications, but if you need certain apps for your device to be a daily driver (such as Uber) then this may be an approach you want to consider
