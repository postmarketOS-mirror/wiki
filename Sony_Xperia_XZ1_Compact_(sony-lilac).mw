== How to enter flash mode ==
With device powered off, hold [VOLUME +] and plug USB cable in. Device's LED will turn blue, meaning it has entered fastboot mode.

== Force power off ==
Hold [VOLUME +] and power button for several seconds.

== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. WiFi, photos, ... -->

== Notes ==
Kernel boots up to the point where the phone displays "CHARGING MODE: error starting charging-sdl". It has been tested with firmware 47.2.A.10.107.

Unfortunately USB networking does not work at the moment, so further investigation is difficult.

The simplest method to see dmesg messages after a freeze during boot up:
* boot a postmarketOS image (pmbootstrap flasher boot)
* disconnect the USB cable as soon as the boot process starts (e.g. when Sony logo appears)
* keep holding [VOLUME -] to start the recovery
* in recovery, start terminal and run 'cat /sys/fs/pstore/console-ramoops'
(based on [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Troubleshooting:boot boot process troubleshooting wiki])
