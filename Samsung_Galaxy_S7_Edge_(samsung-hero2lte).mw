== How to enter flash mode ==
When the device is fully powered off, hold Power and Volume Down for a few seconds.

A (turquoise) download mode warning screen should appear, press Volume Up to confirm.

== Installation ==
It is recommended to sideload an android recovery zip through TWRP for the easiest process, since heimdall freaks out about the subpartitions in SYSTEM and won't move past ~7%.
You can use <code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</code> and then use netcat or similar to flash SYSTEM, but this is a longer and more redundant method.

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap install --android-recovery-zip
$ pmbootstrap flasher --method=adb sideload
</syntaxhighlight>

== What is tested and works ==
* The kernel
* USB Networking (you might have to set its MAC address beforehand though)
* SSH 
* Telnet in the initramfs
* Wi-fi
* Almost all display environments with software rendering (yes, even plasma mobile works, albeit slowly and with rubbish dpi scaling)
  * As an aside, wayland based environments currently crash after a few minutes due to an unknown issue.

== Quirks ==
* Exynos (at least modern exynos) has a different dt.img format to Qualcomm devices, requiring a special dtbtool to go along with it. It has been packaged as exynos-dtbtool ({{MR|527|pmaports}}) and is being used to generate the device tree blob.
* Camera drivers (Samsung FIMC-IS2) (and accompanying flash LED drivers, controlled by a Samsung PMIC) needed to be disabled in the kernel to prevent boot loops.

== To get working ==
* FDE with osk-sdl - Tested and interface works, but crashes and bootloops attempting any decryption
* Halium support
* Mainlining (should probably help the android community too)
