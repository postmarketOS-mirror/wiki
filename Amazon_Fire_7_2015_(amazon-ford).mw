== Unlock the bootloader ==
Before installing pmOS, you will need to unlock your bootloader by following the instructions here: 
https://forum.xda-developers.com/amazon-fire/development/unlock-fire-t3899860

== Entering recovery mode ==
* Press and hold the power button and the left volume button until the device powers on. The Amazon splash screen should be visible, with the addition of text on the left side of the display reading "=> RECOVERY MODE...".

== Installation ==
Booting into TWRP and flashing a pmOS zip made with 'pmbootstrap install --android-recovery-zip' works. Fastboot has not been tested yet.

== What works ==
* Installing via TWRP
* USB Networking
* Touchscreen (needs configuring, read Issues section)
* Display (works but needs msm-fb-refresher)
* Wayland
* XWayland
* Battery
* USB OTG (tested with USB sound card and external keyboard)

== What doesn't work or hasn't been tested ==
* Wi-Fi (no driver)
* Bluetooth
* FDE
* Audio from the internal speaker and headphone jack
* Cameras
* Anything else that isn't filled in 

== Kernel compilation issues when using ggow's amazon MT8127 kernel ==
* virtual_sensor_cpufreq_cooling.c in drivers/thermal needs to be modified to use #include "thermal_core.h" instead of #include <thermal_core.h>
* tpd_debug.c in arch/arm/mach-mt8127/ford/touchpanel needs to be modified to use #include "tpd.h" instead of #include <tpd.h>
** Without these two changes to the kernel source, the kernel will fail to compile.
** The only kernels from ggow's "android_kernel_amazon_mt8127-common" repo that work with these fixes are cm-12.1 and amazon-5364.

* The kernel can only be compiled with gcc6 or gcc4.

== Other issues ==
* The touchscreen will be flipped vertically even though the screen itself is in a horizontal resolution. This can be fixed by creating '/etc/udev/rules.d/90-android-touch-dev.rules' and appending these lines to the file:
ENV{ID_INPUT}="1", ENV{ID_INPUT_TOUCHSCREEN}="1", \

ENV{LIBINPUT_CALIBRATION_MATRIX}="0 1 0 -1 0 1"

* The screen will not refresh on a fresh install. 'msm-fb-refresher' can be installed to fix this issue.
