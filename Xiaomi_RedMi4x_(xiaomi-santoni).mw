== What works ==
* Boots
* Screen
* Touch
* Flashing
* Battery
* USB host mode
* HID buttons (KEY_POWER, KEY_VOLUMEDOWN and KEY_VOLUMEUP)
== What does not work ==
* USB Networking
** In /sys/devices/soc/78db000.usb/msm_hsusb/ there are two files (is_peripheral and is_otg) that might have to do with switching device-type, but they're both 0 and writing 1 to either results in I/O errors
* USB device mode
* Wireless LAN
* Audio
* Mainline
* Camera
* GPS
* Mobile Data
* SMS
* Calls
* Accelerometers
* Bluetooth
* Accelerated 3D graphics
* Backlight stays on when the phone goes into "sleep" because of a lack of user interaction

== How to enter flash mode ==
Turn the phone off and press and hold both the power and volume button at the same time.
Keep holding those buttons untill a picture of the Xiaomi bunny appears.

== Installation ==
Installation over fastboot works, 
android recovery zip installation is untested.
