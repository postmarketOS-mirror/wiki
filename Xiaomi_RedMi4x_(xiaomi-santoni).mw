== Contributors ==

* Danct12

== Maintainer(s) ==
* pinoaffe (old Xiaomi kernel)
* Danct12 (upstreamed msm-3.18 kernel)

== What works ==
* Install to SD Card
* Boots
* Flashing (never tested, but should work as expected)
* Touch
* Wayland
* XWayland
* USB Ethernet/Internet
* WiFi (WCNSS Prima, blobs are needed)
* Vibrator
* Audio (extra steps required)
* USB OTG

== What does not work ==
* Camera (Detected as /dev/video32 and /dev/video33, but accessing them will result in a kernel lock)
* GPS
* Mobile Data
* SMS
* Calls
* Accelerometers
* Bluetooth
* 3D Acceleration (will never happen due to downstream kernel)
* Backlight stays on when the phone goes into "sleep" because of a lack of user interaction

== Extra steps to get things working ==
=== Audio ===
TO-DO

=== Wi-Fi ===
TO-DO, again.

== Bootloader Unlocking ==
Like other Xiaomi devices, the user will have to acquire the bootloader unlock key: https://en.miui.com/unlock

The device will not unlock if the device isn't 7 days old (from the time when your device connects to internet and turned on)

Unlocking bootloaders on Xiaomi devices will '''void''' your warranty, except for the Pocophone.

== Key combinations for entering Recovery/Fastboot ==
=== Recovery ===
* Turn the device off (or restart also works)
* Hold both volume buttons (+ and -) before the device vibrates (Power On Self Test)
* Keep holding until you got to recovery.

=== Fastboot ===
* Same as recovery, but this time hold the volume down key instead of both keys.

== Installation ==
Installation over fastboot works, Android recovery zip installation is untested.
