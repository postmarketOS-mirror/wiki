== Problems ==
* fastboot cannot flash larger images (512 MB or above), it will error with <code>FAILED Unknown chunk type</code>. The latest pmbootstrap should warn you about this. A good fix for this would be implementing our own "postmarketOS flash method", see [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/456#issuecomment-343686341 #456]
* Wifi doesn't work {{github|932}}
* X11 only shows a flickering gray screen {{github|902}}
* <del>Plasma Mobile doesn't work, even with --framebuffer</del> Works, albeit with off colors, as of [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/1252 #1252]

== How to enter flash mode ==

'''Fastboot''': Hold down POWER and VOL DOWN   

'''Recovery''': Hold down POWER and VOL UP until the silver "Kindle Fire" shows up. Then let go of POWER.

== Preparing for install ==
Unlock your bootloader and install TWRP. ''SAFESTRAP WILL NOT WORK!!'' 
 
This will automatically do it: https://forum.xda-developers.com/kindle-fire-hdx/general/multi-platform-1-click-bootloader-t3241014  
  
However, there is a manual tutorial here: https://forum.xda-developers.com/kindle-fire-hdx/general/thor-unlocking-bootloader-firmware-t3463982

== Installation ==
{{note|Fastboot may not be working anymore, because the "vendor id" flag can't be used anymore ({{issue|1830}}). If you own the device, please test this and report back in the issue or remove this warning if you find that it works. We could bring the flag back in theory, if absolutely necessary (though flashing via TWRP seems to be working in any case).}}
'''(TWRP)'''
A recovery image can be flashed via TWRP normally

'''(Fastboot)'''
Fastboot also works, however please note that images that are 510+ MB cannot be flashed via Fastboot. Use netcat or recovery.
