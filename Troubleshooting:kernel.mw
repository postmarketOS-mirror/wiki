Here are some common kernel compilation problems listed. For debugging a kernel that compiles, but does not boot, see [[Troubleshooting:boot]].

== How to create a patch ==
Patching a kernel is as simple as putting a <code>.patch</code> file in your <code>aports/device/linux-vendor-flavor</code> folder and adding the patch name to the <code>source</code> variable in your <code>APKBUILD</code> file. See also: [[How to create a patch when packaging software]].

== undefined reference to kgsl_iommu_sync_lock ==
<pre>drivers/built-in.o:(.data.rel+0x68c): undefined reference to kgsl_iommu_sync_lock'
drivers/built-in.o:(.data.rel+0x690): undefined reference to kgsl_iommu_sync_unlock'</pre>
You need to apply the [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/master/aports/device/linux-lg-mako/02_gpu-msm-fix-gcc5-compile.patch gpu-msm-fix-gcc5-compile.patch] patch.

== How can I boot the kernel with some specific arguments? ==
You can configure <code>CONFIG_CMDLINE</code> so that the arguments are permanent or change it in boot time using fastboot or pmbootstrap, for example:

<pre>fastboot boot -c &quot;console=ttyHSL0,115200,n8&quot; ...

pmbootstrap flasher boot --cmdline &quot;PMOS_NO_OUTPUT_REDIRECT&quot;</pre>
== MSM framebuffer doesn't work ==
We found out that removing the 3D driver support makes the MSM framebuffer. See [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/66 #66].

<pre>CONFIG_MSM_KGSL=n</pre>
== PTY allocation request failed ==
<pre>PTY allocation request failed on channel 0
-ash: a: unknown operand</pre>
Go to [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/wiki/Troubleshooting%3Akernel#common-configurations Common configurations], you have probably missed <code>CONFIG_DEVTMPFS</code>!

== Kernel compilation: (some header file): No such file or directory ==
Busybox' <code>zip</code> implementation does not extract symlinks. There are two workarounds. One is to use another archive type (typically kernel sources are downloaded from GitHub, where you can also get the source as <code>.tar.gz</code> - simply by changing the extension in the URL).

The other workaround is to add <code>unzip</code> to the makedepends, so it uses the original unzip instead of the busybox version.

(This has been fixed in busybox in the meantime.)

== Kernel compilation: thumb conditional instruction should be in IT block ==
<pre>
arch/arm/crypto/aesbs-core.S:449: Error: thumb conditional instruction should be in IT block -- `addeq r6,r6,#0x10'
arch/arm/crypto/aesbs-core.S:904: Error: thumb conditional instruction should be in IT block -- `addeq r6,r6,#0x10'
arch/arm/crypto/aesbs-core.S:2100: Error: thumb conditional instruction should be in IT block -- `subne r9,#0x10'
</pre>

You can fix it by disabling <code>CONFIG_CRYPTO_AES_ARM_BS</code>.

On some other devices, like Huawei P7, you might also need to disable all CRYPTO flags containing ARM (<code>CONFIG_CRYPTO_{algorithm name}_ARM</code>), which are ARM NEON optimizations.

This was first noticed in {{MR|144|pmaports}}.

== Kernel compilation: BusyBox lzma compression fails ==
In case you get the following output:

<pre>LZMA    arch/arm/boot/compressed/piggy.lzma
lzma: unrecognized option: 9
BusyBox v1.26.2 (2017-06-11 06:37:13 GMT) multi-call binary.

Usage: lzma -d [-cf] [FILE]...

Decompress FILE (or stdin)

        -d      Decompress
        -c      Write to stdout
        -f      Force</pre>
In the BusyBox version shipped with Alpine Linux, only lower compression levels are enabled (to reduce the binary size). The kernel you're building is configured to compress with LZMA at the highest compression level. Pick one of the following solutions:

* Add <code>xz</code> to the <code>makedepends=</code> line. Then the &quot;real&quot; lzma binary will be used instead of the Busybox version. This is '''recommended''', because then your kernel will get built most similar to how it is built elsewhere, so you have the lowest risk of introducing a reason for the kernel not to boot (because the kernel is too big in size or something like that)
* Reduce the compression ratio by adding [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/b4c9f93f0d7be1272f6a67de2128558ce58e1077/aports/linux-samsung-i9070/02_reduce_lzo_compression.patch this patch]. This will not introduce any dependency, but increase the kernel size.
* Use another compression algorithm (run <code>pmbootstrap menuconfig linux-...</code> and change it there). Gzip should work, but will produce a big kernel, because pmbootstrap currently installs a workaround to always use the fastest compression method (<code>-1</code>), when the most compressing one (<code>-9</code>) is chosen. This will increase the kernel size the most.

== Android Kernel compilation fails on warnings (not on errors) (-Werror) ==
Don't even bother fixing all those warnings, there are too many of them and we don't want the outdated Android kernels in the long run anyway! When you generate your kernel APKBUILD with <code>pmbootstrap init</code>, then you should have code in the <code>prepare()</code> that automatically removes the <code>-Werror</code> parameter in all Makefiles.

== Building the kernel with Android's build system ==
It might be useful for debugging to build Android's kernel with Android's build system.

You can follow the LineageOS building guide for your device (see [https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/titan/build this] for titan device as example).

The process should be similar for other devices:

<source lang="bash"># make some directories
mkdir -p ~/bin
mkdir -p ~/android/lineage

# download the 'repo' tool
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

# clone LineageOS
cd ~/android/lineage
~/bin/repo init -u https://github.com/LineageOS/android.git -b cm-14.1

# Download the rest of dependencies (this will take a while and about *TODO* GB of disk space)
~/bin/repo sync

# now prepare the build for your device (replace 'titan' with the device you want to for the kernel for)
source build/envsetup.sh
breakfast titan

# Now instead of following the rest of the guide (which will compile both Android and the kernel
#  for your device), simply compile the kernel:
mka kernel

# This command will also generate the device tree, initramfs and boot.img images
mka bootimage</source>
You can check the <code>$OUT</code> environment variable and cd into it. In the case of titan the interesting generated files are:

* <code>~/android/lineage/out/target/product/titan/boot.img</code> (boot image ready to be flashed: kernel + initramfs)
* <code>~/android/lineage/out/target/product/titan/dt.img</code> (device trees)
* <code>~/android/lineage/out/target/product/titan/kernel</code> (linux image)
* <code>~/android/lineage/out/target/product/titan/ramdisk.img</code> (compressed initramfs)

The defconfig used is available at <code>~/android/lineage/kernel/motorola/msm8226/arch/arm/configs/titan_defconfig</code>

== TLS (SSL/HTTPS) is broken! ==
If you see messages like these, when trying to access HTTPS pages, read on:
<pre>
Connecting to pastebin.com (104.20.209.21:443)
ssl_client: pastebin.com: TLS connect failed
wget: error getting response: Connection reset by peer
</pre>

You are probably running an older kernel (pre 3.17), which does not yet have the "getrandom" syscall. This is required by modern openssl/libressl versions (Alpine was on libressl for a long time, then switched back to openssl). Check your kernel version, and if that is the case, and [[the Mainline Kernel|mainlining]] is not feasible for you, consider backporting the getrandom syscall like done in {{MR|69|pmaports}}. This issue was discussed in {{issue|107|pmaports}}.
