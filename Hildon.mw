This is the desktop from Maemo, which is a Debian-based distribution, that originally ran on the N900.<br />
We do not have a <code>postmarketos-ui-hildon</code> yet (but that should be easy to make, look at <code>postmarketos-ui-weston</code> for reference if you're interested, dear reader).

=== Installation instructions ===

Add following packages as extra in pmbootstrap init: 
<pre>mesa,mesa-dri-swrast,hildon-desktop,hildon-theme-alpha</pre>

Notice that due to swrast being used (probably) this is way too slow to be usable on N900. Even typing in xfce4-terminal results in one second lag.


To make hildon-desktop find its theme (install hildom-theme-alpha first):

<pre class="shell">sudo ln -s /usr/share/themes/alpha /usr/share/themes/default</pre>
For default wallpapers:

<pre>mkdir ~/.backgrounds
cp /usr/share/themes/alpha/backgrounds/wallpaper1.png ~/.backgrounds/background-1.png
cp /usr/share/themes/alpha/backgrounds/wallpaper2.png ~/.backgrounds/background-2.png
cp /usr/share/themes/alpha/backgrounds/wallpaper3.png ~/.backgrounds/background-3.png
cp /usr/share/themes/alpha/backgrounds/wallpaper4.png ~/.backgrounds/background-4.png</pre>

You can then verify correct operation by ssh-ing in, as root:

<pre>
sudo mv /etc/profile.d/start_weston.sh /etc
sudo killall weston
sudo rc-update add dbus default
Xorg &
DISPLAY=:0
export DISPLAY
hildon-desktop
</pre>

=== Running ===

Run <code>sudo setup-xorg-base</code>.

To run hildon-desktop, create a <code>~/.xinitrc</code> with the following contents:

<pre>
if which dbus-launch >/dev/null && test -z "$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS"; then
    eval `dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session`
fi
export LC_MESSAGES=en_GB.UTF-8
exec hildon-desktop
</pre>

You will also have to install <code>dbus-x11</code> in order to get <code>dbus-launch</code>. Depending on the device you have, you may also have to install <code>mesa-dri-swrast</code>.

hildon-desktop can then be started by running <code>startx</code>.
