This is the desktop from Maemo, which is a Debian-based distribution, that originally ran on the N900.<br />
We do not have a <code>postmarketos-ui-hildon</code> yet (but that should be easy to make, look at <code>postmarketos-ui-weston</code> for reference if you're interested, dear reader).

=== Installation instructions ===

To make hildon-desktop find its theme (install hildom-theme-alpha first):

<pre class="shell">ln -s /usr/share/themes/alpha /usr/share/themes/default</pre>
For default wallpapers:

<pre>cp /usr/share/themes/alpha/backgrounds/wallpaper1.png ~/.backgrounds/background-1.png
cp /usr/share/themes/alpha/backgrounds/wallpaper2.png ~/.backgrounds/background-2.png
cp /usr/share/themes/alpha/backgrounds/wallpaper3.png ~/.backgrounds/background-3.png
cp /usr/share/themes/alpha/backgrounds/wallpaper4.png ~/.backgrounds/background-4.png</pre>
