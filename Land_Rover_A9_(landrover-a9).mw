<ul>
<li>a boot.img file with kernel, initramfs and dtb file from pmOS does ''not'' work.</li>
<li>alexlep has a boot.img file from the vendor somewhere (extracted from the device?), that works when flashed via <code>fastboot boot</code>. It can not be extracted like a normal boot.img file, as reported on IRC. Probably the extraction tool can't handle the files.</li>
<li><p>according to alexlep, there is a 512b header in front of the kernel and initramfs:</p>
<blockquote><p>ramdisk and kernel has 512 bytes added in the beginning of the files</p>
<p>custom header with file description</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>...and simply prepending that header in front of a custom initramfs/kernel does not work, as he reports.</p></li></ul>
