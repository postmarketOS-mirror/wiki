The [https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/ PinePhone] is a smartphone by PINE64. The postmarketOS vendor and device names are "pine64" and "pinephone" respectively. The back panel can be lifted off by pulling at the notch on the bottom-right corner of the phone. This exposes the battery, microSD and SIM slots, and dipswitches. It comes with a 3000mAh battery and uses the same form-factor as the Samsung J7 for replacement.

== Installation ==

{{hint|'''Hint:''' The PinePhone will boot to the microSD card first if it's bootable, or the eMMC if not.}}

The recommended installation procedure is installing to a microSD card by following the [[Installation guide|Installation Guide]] and to pass "--sdcard=/dev/(...)" to "pmbootstrap install". 

{{hint|'''Hint:''' Passing the additional option "--fde" to "pmbootstrap install" will create a LUKS root partition on the target device and will allow you to set a password during the installation process.}}

{{note|'''Note:''' The above option may throw the following error when entering a passphrase "WARNING: Locking directory /run/cryptsetup is missing!" This can be safely ignored See [https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2019/02/msg00100.html here].}}

postmarketOS can be installed onto the eMMC by flashing [https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive/releases Jumpdrive] onto a microSD, booting it with the USB connected to the PC and following the microSD install instructions above or by booting a Linux distribution on the phone first and doing the installation process via pmbootstrap on the phone directly:

# Install [[Installing pmbootstrap|pmbootstrap]] and its dependencies on the phone on any Linux distribution booted via the microSD card
# Follow the [[Installation guide|Installation Guide]] until "Installation and flashing"
# Run "pmbootstrap install --sdcard=/dev/mmcblk2"

If this throws an error mentioning "/dev/installp2" when trying to install from postmarketOS on the microSD card over an existing installation of postmarketOS on the eMMC (including the factory test image), the partitions of the existing installation on the eMMC need to be deleted and the phone needs to be rebooted once after doing so due to a bug, see [https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=9107&pid=59870 here]

postmarketOS can also be installed using premade images from [https://images.postmarketos.org/pinephone/ here]. Some of these images are purely for demoing specific things and aren't usable for general use and will never be. These images can be installed by using dd, or your favorite image writer.

{{note|'''Note:''' This requires sufficient space on the microSD, partitions created from images using dd need to be resized.}}

Installing postmarketOS on the eMMC directly from a computer via FEL is also supported. This requires the user to [https://linux-sunxi.org/FEL#Triggering_FEL_mode enable FEL mode], the [https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/NOOB#Flashing_to_eMMC_using_FEL_.28Allwinner_A64_Devices_Only.29 boot-tools] to mount the eMMC as mass storage are currently however not compatible.

== Serial console ==
The PinePhone has a serial port in the headphone connector, it's activated by the 6th contact on the dipswitch. If the switch is on then the headphone connector is in audio mode, if it's off then it's in UART mode.

The uart is 115200n8

The pinout for the serial connector on the headphone jack is:

* Tip: RX
* Ring: TX
* Sleeve: GND

The serial connection is 3.3V

You can also buy the debug cable from [https://store.pine64.org PINE64 Store]
The store cable uses a 4 ring plug, as seen in the [http://files.pine64.org/doc/pinebook/guide/Pinebook_Earphone_Serial_Console_Developer_Guide.pdf PDF], but a 3 ring plug works just as well.

[[File:PinePhone-main-board.jpg|frameless]]

== Hardware switches ==

There's a 6 contact dipswitch on the back of the phone underneath the back cover. The 6 switches are for enableing/disableing hardware components. The switch has tiny numbers 1-6 beneath the contacts, moving the contact up sets that contact on.

=== Cameras ===

The cameras both share the csi-0 bus. Currently only the rear camera (OV5640) has mainline linux support.

It's also not clear how the camera switching would work on the software side, the current issue is that the sunxi csi driver doesn't support multiple camera endpoints.

The camera hardware pipeline is controlled with <code>/dev/media1</code> and <code>media-ctl</code>, the result is on <code>/dev/video1</code>

<source lang="shell-session">
pinephone:~# media-ctl -d /dev/media1 --set-v4l2 '"ov5640 3-004c":0[fmt:UYVY8_2X8/1280x720]'
pinephone:~# ffmpeg -s 1280x720 -f video4linux2 -i /dev/video1 -vframes 1 selfie.jpg
</source>

[[File:Pinephone-camera-demo.jpg|frameless]]

=== Camera Flash ===

''Please note, that the driver for the sgm3140 is not yet included in the main kernel source and as such is not available for use yet without compiling the module yourself.''

The camera flash consist out of a SG Micro SGM3140 "500mA Buck/Boost Charge Pump LED Driver" and a EHP-C04 LED. It supports Flash and Torch mode, the first being brighter but only for 200-300ms, when it switches to Torch mode automatically. Torch mode is lower brightness but can be turned on continuously.

Controlling the flash from user space is possible via sysfs and via v4l2:

<source lang="shell-session">
# Torch on
$ echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/white\:flash/brightness
# Torch off
$ echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/white\:flash/brightness
# Activate flash
$ echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/white\:flash/flash_strobe
</source>

<source lang="shell-session">
# Torch on
$ v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video1 -c led_mode=2
# Torch off
$ v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video1 -c led_mode=0
# Activate flash
$ v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video1 -c led_mode=1
$ v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video1 -c strobe=1
</source>

=== WiFi ===

The wifi uses the rtl8723cs driver and is functional. There is still an issue with the driver not reloading correctly when the SoC is put into suspend mode, this can be worked around by reloading the kernel module:

<source lang="shell-session">
pinephone:~# sudo rmmod 8723cs
pinephone:~# sudo modprobe 8723cs
</source>

=== Bluetooth ===
Main article: [[Bluetooth]].

The bluetooth connection is handled by the wifi chipset. It is functional but there is no integration in Plasma Mobile yet. To pair a bluetooth device start the bluetooth service and use bluetoothctl to connect.

<source lang="shell-session">
pinephone:~# sudo service bluetooth start
pinephone:~# bluetoothctl
# scan on
[NEW] 00:11:22:33:44:55
# pair 00:11:22:33:44:55
</source>

To use bluetooth headphones with pulseaudio, the package <code>pulseaudio-bluez</code> is required.

=== Modem ===

Receiving and sending text messages works, The calls work but there are some issues left with the audio routing. Mobile data is functional.
For information on audio routing and setting up the modem in [[phosh]], see the specific article.

To bring up mobile data run the following commands (for plasma mobile):

<source lang="shell-session">
pinephone:~# sudo apk add ofonoctl
pinephone:~# ofonoctl wan --connect --append-dns
</source>

In order to connect to the serial console of the modem, you need a terminal application. One option is to use <code>minicom</code>.

<source lang="shell-session">
# apk add minicom
</source>

Connect to the console by issuing:

<source lang="shell-session">
# minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB2
</source>

The command <code>AT</code> returns OK:

<source lang="shell-session">
AT
OK
</source>

The command <code>ATI</code> returns some version information from the modem:

<source lang="shell-session">
ATI
Quectel
EG25
Revision: EG25GGBR07A07M2G

OK
</source>

The command <code>AT+QDAI</code> (Digital Audio Interface Configure) is used to configure the digital audio interface. <code>AT+QDAI?</code> returns the current configuration:

<source lang="shell-session">
AT+QDAI?
+QDAI: 3,0,0,4,0,0,1,1

OK
</source>


Some more details on how to configure the modem is available [https://megous.com/dl/tmp/modem.txt here]. The reference for the available commands is the [https://itbrainpower.net/downloadables/Quectel_EC25_EC21_AT_Commands_Manual_V1.0.pdf EC25 & EC21 AT Commands Manual].

=== Sensors ===

All sensors work and are accessible as Industrial I/O (iio) devices in Linux. To query the data you can cat the files in `/sys/bus/iio/` to make the kernel module query the sensors

<source lang="shell-session">
pinephone:~# cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/name
mpu6050
pinephone:~# cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/in_accel_z_raw
-17594
pinephone:~# echo "Verified gravity still exists"
</source>

=== RGB Led ===

<source lang="shell-session">
# Activate LED
echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/$COLOR/brightness
# Deactivate LED
echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/$COLOR/brightness
</source>

You may turn on and off the blue led by issuing:

<source lang="shell-session">
# echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/leds/leds/pinephone\:blue\:user/brightness
# echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/leds/leds/pinephone\:blue\:user/brightness
</source>

Make sure you run these commands as root (<code>sudo -i</code>), <code>sudo echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/leds/leds/pinephone\:blue\:user/brightness</code>, won't work.

=== Audio ===

==== Speakers ====

Sound output should work after unmuting <code>AIF1 Slot 0 digital</code>

Start by making sure alsa-utils are installed:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ sudo apk add alsa-utils
</source>

You may use amixer, or alsamixer to unmute the required channels, and to control the volume:

Amixer:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ amixer scontents
$ amixer sset Master unmute
</source> 

Alsamixer (use terminal keyboard input to use up/down/left/right keys, to set volume and select devices):
<source lang="shell-session">
$ alsamixer -V all
</source>

Test the sound output by issuing:

<source lang="shell-session">
$ speaker-test -c3
</source>

== Troubleshooting ==
=== Failed to create boot/xxx: No space left on device ===
A bug has been observed where too many initramfs's are created. To fix, run the following commands to delete and regenerate all initramfs's
<source lang="shell-session">
postmarketos:~# sudo rm /boot/initramfs*
postmarketos:~# sudo apk fix linux-postmarketos-allwinner
</source>
=== Qt Based Browsers Not Loading Web Pages ===
Webkit sandbox is broken in the current build. In order to be able to use Qt based browsers it is necessary to create the file "/etc/profile.d/sandboxhack.sh" with the following contents:
<source lang="shell-session">
#!/bin/sh
export QTWEBENGINE_DISABLE_SANDBOX=1
</source>
This sets an environment variable that kills the webkit sandbox because that's broken in the current build. This should be fixed already for the chromium musl build but not yet for all qtwebkit based browsers. This is being worked on [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/issues/435 here] and [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/issues/32 here].
