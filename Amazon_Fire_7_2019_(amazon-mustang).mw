== How to unlock bootloader ==
The bootloader can now be through a hardware method: https://forum.xda-developers.com/amazon-fire/orig-development/fire-7-2019-mustang-unbrick-downgrade-t3944365
== How to enter flash mode ==
Press and hold {{Button|Power}} + {{Button|Volume Up}}
== Installation ==
Due to the fact that fastboot doesn't work even after using the amonet exploit, you will need to export the boot image and flash it with twrp. Then flash this [https://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=4518684&d=1528181879 dummy zip] which will force twrp to reapply the amonet exploit. 

Another option is exporting a flashable zip that can be flashed using twrp.
Refer to [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Installation_guide Installation Guide for postmarketOS]

== Amonet ==
Amonet is lk exploit used to boot unsigend kernel. Sources of amonet are avalible here: https://github.com/xyzz/amonet/tree/mustang.
This exploit is installed by bootrom exploit. But probably some 2nd stage bootloader is good idea.
== Mainlining ==
There is some work on mt8163 mainline, for amazon-karnak, but it will be easy to get it on mustang. For now serial console and simplefb is working. Pwrap and pmic seems to be working. https://github.com/mt8163-mainline/linux

== Device problems ==
* Mainline is not yet usable.
* Panfrost (driver for mali-t720) is wip, and not avalible in downstream (Merged in linux 5.2)
* This device use exploit due to locked bootloader. See #Amonet.
* This device's bl is not very good for running linux, due to it appends much of bad cmdline params, and some things in device tree.
