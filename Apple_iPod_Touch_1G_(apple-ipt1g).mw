== Progress ==

The iPod can boot Linux with the openiboot firmware which has to be build first. The openiboot firmware is not made for GCC6 and requires a few patches, it's also written for the arm-elf toolchain but it can be built with the arm-eabi toolchain for now which seems to work.

This is also the slowest device yet since it uses a 412 Mhz ARMv6 single-core cpu (Samsung S5L8900) and 128 MB ram. It has also has a PowerVR GPU which can cause trouble with porting.

* [https://github.com/planetbeing/iphonelinux iphonelinux] (Also this wiki has a lot of useful info)
* [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/tree/device/ipod1 pmos branch], old scheme, aports/main/openiboot would need to be copied to the new pmbootstrap (now pmbootstrap and pmaports repos are splitted), and in the future ported to gcc8 for maintainability (low priority)
