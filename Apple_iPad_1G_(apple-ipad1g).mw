== Progress ==
Can boot into a mainline linux kernel, but the bootloader isn't persistent so it can only boot tethered.

== Booting ==

# Install syringe package in chroot
# Enter DFU mode (hold  {{button|power}} and  {{button|home}} with USB connected to computer)
# load openiboot

<source lang="shell-session">
$ loadibec openiboot-ipad1g.bin
</source>

expect script for automating booting with <code>oibc</code>:

<source lang="expect">
#!/usr/bin/expect
spawn oibc

send "!/path/to/vmlinuz\r"
sleep 0.1
send "\r"
expect "Received file"
send "kernel \"console=tty0 PMOS_NO_OUTPUT_REDIRECT\"\r"
expect "Done: kernel"

send "!/path/to/initramfs\r"
sleep 0.1
send "\r"
expect "Received file"
send "initrd\r"
expect "Done: initrd"
send "wait_boot 15000\r"
expect "Done: boot"
</source>

* Set <code>console=ttySAC0</code> for UART console instead of framebuffer
* <code>earlycon=s3c2410,0x82500000</code> and <code>keep_bootcon</code> may be useful too.
