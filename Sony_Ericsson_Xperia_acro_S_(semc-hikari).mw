== What works ==

This device uses a non-standard ELF format boot.img file that is not supported by postmarketOS (yet):
 % file boot.img
 boot.img: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1 (ARM), statically linked, corrupted section header size

intgr has a working hacked postmarketOS toolchain for building compatible boot.img files.

== What does not work ==

Booting.

After trying out tens of different combinations of kernel sources from the web, I couldn't find any that get as far as initramfs.

The best sources found [https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/JPtybJNYv2/ crash pretty late in the initialization process] with error:

 BUG: Bad page state in process swapper/0  pfn:5dcba

== How to enter flash mode ==
Power off the device. Hold Volume Up as you plug the USB cable into the device.

Alternatively, perform a hard reset by holding Power and Volume Up buttons. When the device vibrates, release the Power button *first*, and it will boot into fastboot loader.

== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->

Follow [https://developer.sony.com/develop/open-devices/get-started/unlock-bootloader Sony's instructions to unlock the bootloader].
