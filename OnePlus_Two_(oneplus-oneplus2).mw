== How to enter flash mode ==

From a power off state, hold the '''volume up''' and '''power''' buttons until the device vibrates. The display should then light up and say "Fastboot Mode".

== Installation ==

I had some issues with default installation procedure ( install-> flash_system -> flash_kernel)
Get it working by installing recovery with TWRP:
 <pre>pmbootstrap install --no-fde --android-recovery-zip</pre> 

next copy zip file to device and install using twrp 

in flash boot mode : <pre>pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</pre>
