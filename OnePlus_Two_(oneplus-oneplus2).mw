== How to enter flash mode ==

From a power off state, hold the '''volume up''' and '''power''' buttons until the device vibrates. The display should then light up and say "Fastboot Mode".

== Installation ==

I ran into networking issues with default installation procedure ( install-> flash_rootfs -> flash_kernel)
Get it working by installing recovery with TWRP:
 <pre>pmbootstrap install --android-recovery-zip</pre> 

WARNING(FIXME): Results in 'boot partition not found'

next copy zip file to device and install it using twrp 

in fastboot mode : <pre>pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</pre>
