== Serial console ==

There is a 3.3V uart on the 2x5pin connector near the modem. The pin in the corner toward VOL- is GND and the next pin is TX.

[[File:Pine-dontbeevil-uart.jpg|frameless]]

The baudrate in u-boot and in Linux is 115200n8

On a functional devkit with a pmos SD card inserted you should get the standard u-boot console messages on the serial port as soon as you power the devkit on, and after that the linux kernel messages.

=== Touchscreen ===

The touchscreen is controlled by the <code>edt_ft5x06</code> module on i2c-0. The current issue is that it takes a long while before the i2c-0 bus works after booting. For some reason it takes ~110 seconds before communication is possible. This causes an issue because the module tries to probe the touchscreen before the bus works. 

The current workaround is to build <code>edt_ft5x06</code> as a module and rmmod/modprobe the module after the i2c-0 bus works so it gets probed again.

<source lang="dmesg">
[   17.942111] edt_ft5x06 0-0038: touchscreen probe failed
...after rmmod edt_ft5x06; modprobe edt_ft5x06...
[ 3989.326377] input: generic ft5x06 (12) as /devices/platform/soc/1c2ac00.i2c/i2c-0/0-0038/input/input2
</source>

The communication to the touchscreen controller is only possible when power is supplied the the 4G modem using the hardware switch (the light should be off) since the power rail for the 4G modem is used as pull-up for the i2c bus that connects the touchscreen controller to the sopine.

=== Cameras ===

The camera's both share the csi-0 bus. Currently only the rear camera (OV5640) has mainline linux support.

It's also not clear how the camera switching would work on the software side, maybe Linux just deals with it if the device tree nodes for the second camera get added.

The camera hardware pipeline is controlled with <code>/dev/media0</code> and <code>media-ctl</code>, the result is on <code>/dev/video0</code>

<source lang="shell-session">
pine-dontbeevil:~# media-ctl --set-v4l2 '"ov5640 2-003c":0[fmt:UYVY8_2X8/1280x720]'
pine-dontbeevil:~# ffmpeg -s 1280x720 -f video4linux2 -i /dev/video0 -vframes 1 selfie.jpg
</source>

=== WiFi/Bluetooth ===

The wifi interface shows up and is able to scan for networks, it doesn't want to actually connect most of the times, if it doesn't work then reboot and try again.

<source lang="dmesg">

</source>

The bluetooth part of the RTL8723BS isn't supported in mainline yet. Theres a repository with some support at https://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8723bs_bt

=== Modem ===

Haven't looked at yet

=== Sensors ===

All sensors work and are accessible as Industrial I/O (iio) devices in linux. To query the data you can cat the files in `/sys/bus/iio/` to make the kernel module query the sensors

<source lang="shell-session">
dontbeevil:~# cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/name
mpu6050
dontbeevil:~# cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/in_accel_z_raw
-17594
dontbeevil:~# echo "Verified gravity still exists"
</source>

The <code>stk3310</code> module doesn't load automatically, after running <code>modprobe stk3310</code> the third device in `/sys/bus/iio` should show up.

=== RGB Led ===

All the required gpio-led stuff is added to the device tree but the gpio-led module doesn't do anything. No led devices, No errors, No log messages.

=== Audio ===

The A64 SoC audio should work on mainline with the <code>CONFIG_SUN50I_CODEC_ANALOG</code> option enabled. Sound output should work after unmuting <code>AIF1 Slot 0 digital</code>

=== USB ===
Doesn't work for MartijnBraam, reported to work for other people.
