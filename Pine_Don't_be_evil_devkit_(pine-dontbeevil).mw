== Serial console ==

There is a 3.3V uart on the 2x5pin connector near the modem. The pin in the corner toward VOL- is GND and the next pin is TX.

[[File:Pine-dontbeevil-uart.jpg|frameless]]

The baudrate in u-boot and in Linux is 115200n8

=== Touchscreen ===

The touchscreen is controlled by the <code>edt_ft5x06</code> module on i2c-0. The current issue is that it takes a long while before the i2c-0 bus works after booting. For some reason it takes ~110 seconds before communication is possible. This causes an issue because the module tries to probe the touchscreen before the bus works. 

The current workaround is to build <code>edt_ft5x06</code> as a module and rmmod/modprobe the module after the i2c-0 bus works so it gets probed again.

<source lang="dmesg">
[   17.942111] edt_ft5x06 0-0038: touchscreen probe failed
...after rmmod edt_ft5x06; modprobe edt_ft5x06...
[ 3989.326377] input: generic ft5x06 (12) as /devices/platform/soc/1c2ac00.i2c/i2c-0/0-0038/input/input2
</source>

=== Cameras ===

The camera's both share the csi-0 bus. Currently only the rear camera (OV5640) has mainline linux support.

The device tree stuff for the camera has been added but I haven't managed to get any frames from the camera yet. I'm not sure if this an issue with the OV5640 driver or with the allwinner csi kernel module.

It's also not clear how the camera switching would work on the software side, maybe Linux just deals with it if the device tree nodes for the second camera get added.

=== WiFi/Bluetooth ===

The kernel module for the RTL8723BS wifi/bluetooth module has been added but the interface for the wifi chip doesn't show up. There is some 802.11 stuff loaded in the kernel. Needs further debugging.

=== Modem ===

Haven't looked at yet

=== Sensors ===

All sensors work and are accessible as Industrial I/O (iio) devices in linux. To query the data you can cat the files in `/sys/bus/iio/` to make the kernel module query the sensors

<source lang="shell-session">
dontbeevil:~# cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/name
mpu6050
dontbeevil:~# cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/in_accel_z_raw
-17594
dontbeevil:~# echo "Verified gravity still exists"
</source>

The <code>stk3310</code> module doesn't load automatically, after running <code>modprobe stk3310</code> the third device in `/sys/bus/iio` should show up.

=== RGB Led ===

All the required gpio-led stuff is added to the device tree but the gpio-led module doesn't do anything. No led devices, No errors, No log messages.
