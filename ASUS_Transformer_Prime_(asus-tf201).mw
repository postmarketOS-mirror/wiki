== Unlocking ==
The first step to do anything with the device is unlocking, with this device its done by sideloading the unlock apk from ASUS and clicking a few buttons in the app. The apk can be found on [https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/EeePAD/TF201/UnLock_Device_App_V6.apk the ASUS support page].

== Based on ==
Katkiss android [https://forum.xda-developers.com/transformer-tf700/development/rom-t3457417 XDA link]

== Status ==
* Kernel compiles
* Flashable from within recovery (same as [[ASUS_Eee_Pad_Transformer_(asus-tf101)]])
* Doesn't go beyond bootlogo
* Having problems compiling with APANIC flag (to read last_kmesg - and figure out why)

== How to enter flash modes ==
Turn tablet off if it is in system. Then press power and volume down buttons till you feel the vibration. Then release power button only. You will enter bootloader), and from bootloader higher sound to jump to recovery

== Fastboot issue ==
It seems like the bootloader doesn't handle flashing the boot and userdata partition correctly, the official firmware package flashes an "Android blob" to the staging partition with fastboot which triggers an flashing screen on the tablet which copies the data to the correct partitions. Flashing ordinary images using TWRP recovery goes properly.

== Installation ==
You need to be running Katkiss 7.1 (with TWRP 3.0.0 and hairy bean bootloader). Please follow this [https://forum.xda-developers.com/transformer-prime/help/guide-tutorial-asus-transformer-prime-t3486237 guide on XDA] if you're not.

# <pre>./pmbootstrap.py install</pre>
# <pre>./pmbootstrap.py export</pre>
# Reboot the device in recovery
# <pre>adb push /tmp/postmarketOS-export/blob-asus-tf201 /cache</pre>
# <pre>adb push /tmp/postmarketOS-export/asus-tf201.img /cache</pre>

The following should be executed within adb shell:

# <pre>adb shell</pre>
# <pre>dd if=/cache/blob-asus-tf201 of=/dev/block/mmcblk0p4</pre>
# <pre>dd if=/cache/asus-tf201.img of=/dev/block/mmcblk0p1</pre>

Note: Other ways of flashing do not work. This is exactly how the katkiss android ROM is flashed to the device.
