== Unlocking ==
The first step to do anything with the device is unlocking, with this device its done by sideloading the unlock apk from ASUS and clicking a few buttons in the app. The apk can be found on [https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/EeePAD/TF201/UnLock_Device_App_V6.apk the ASUS support page].

== Status ==
* Kernel compiles
* Flashable from within recovery (same as [[ASUS_Eee_Pad_Transformer_(asus-tf101)|Asus Eee Pad Transformer TF101]])
* Doesn't go beyond bootlogo
* Having problems compiling with APANIC flag (to read last_kmesg - and figure out why)

== How to enter flash modes ==
Turn tablet off if it is in the system. Then press POWER and VOL DOWN buttons till you feel the vibration. Then release the POWER only. You will enter the bootloader. In bootloader navigate with VOL DOWN button and to choose option use VOL UP button.

== Fastboot issue ==
The bootloader doesn't handle flashing the boot and userdata partition correctly, the official firmware package flashes an "Android blob" to the staging partition with fastboot which triggers an flashing screen on the tablet which copies the data to the correct partitions. Flashing ordinary images using TWRP recovery goes properly. Using latest TWRP is highly recommended.

== Installation ==
You need to be running Katkiss 7.1 (with TWRP 3.0.0 and hairy bean bootloader). Please follow this [https://forum.xda-developers.com/transformer-prime/help/guide-tutorial-asus-transformer-prime-t3486237 guide on XDA] if you're not.

# <pre>./pmbootstrap.py install</pre>
# <pre>./pmbootstrap.py export</pre>
# Reboot the device in recovery
# <pre>adb push /tmp/postmarketOS-export/blob-asus-tf201 /cache</pre>
# <pre>adb push /tmp/postmarketOS-export/asus-tf201.img /cache</pre>

The following should be executed within adb shell:

# <pre>adb shell</pre>
# <pre>dd if=/cache/blob-asus-tf201 of=/dev/block/mmcblk0p4</pre>
# <pre>dd if=/cache/asus-tf201.img of=/dev/block/mmcblk0p1</pre>

Note: Other ways of flashing do not work. This is exactly how the katkiss android ROM is flashed to the device.

|Booting
|When kernel is larger than approx 8MB, initfs must be packed directly inside kernel (not into boot.img as usual), otherwise kernel won't boot. With downstream kernel it works.
