== How to enter flash mode ==
* Power + Volume Down buttons or use <code>adb reboot-bootloader</code>

== Installation ==
I installed the rootfs on a SD card. Flashing the kernel to the boot partition not tested, rootfs flashing too.
<source>
$ pmbootstrap flasher boot
</source>

== Notes ==
* OTG might not work on mouses, USB sound cards and devices with heavy power requirements, for example USB HDD enclosures (might work with a powered USB hub or a Y USB cable). Also you might need to restart Weston after unplugging and plugging back in a device.
* Xorg works after running <code>cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/modes > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/mode</code> as root and starting the DE manually.
