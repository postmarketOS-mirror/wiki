== Compiling a kernel ==

=== KatKernel ===

* Katkernel is based off the kernel with the same name for the TF300t. An overlap in components makes these kernels mostly compatible hence the rom it belongs to (KatKiss) has been ported to the TF700t aswell. The reason why the kernel is included in this list is because it's currently the most active kernel for the TF700t.
* Source: https://github.com/timduru/tf300t-katkernel/tree/dev-tf700t/
* Version: 3.1.10
* Status: Compiles, is too big to fit on /boot

=== Grate ===

*Grate is a upstream based tree for tegra devices with the goal of actually upstreaming any changes done. Trying to mainline this device should be relatively doable up to a certain point since the Tegra 3 is well supported on this tree. I'll be basing work on this tablet on the TF300t port since that one is the closest in Hardware.
* Sources: https://github.com/grate-driver/linux (or a fork with TF300t support: https://github.com/okias/linux/tree/tf300t)
* Source: https://github.com/jja2000/grate-linux-tf700t/tree/tf700t (Jasper work, initial support)
* Version: 5.5.0-rc5
* Status: Untested, see Hardware Status.

==== Hardware status (mainline) ====
There is '''multiple hardware revisions''', so this status may not apply to all of them. This status apply for tilapia (Bach revision).
