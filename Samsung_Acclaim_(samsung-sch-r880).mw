== Status ==
*Device can be rooted
*Partition map discovered
*boot.img pulled from BML4
*Using a port of Linux 3.0.100 for the Galaxy Spica (same chipset)
*<s>Kernel fails to compile during linking</s>
*Kernel compiles. <s>See warning below.</s>
*Cannot reboot into download mode via key combo (only using adb)
*Cannot flash using Heimdall
*Flashing via Odin may work but I was unsuccessful 
--NO FURTHER TESTING DONE AT THIS POINT
I have given up on this phone for now. Don't have the time to manage it.

== Errors/Warnings ==
I bricked my initial board trying to flash the kernel using a flasher app (same one used for custom recovery). It now freezes at the SAMSUNG logo when powered on and does nothing else. My backup board runs Android 2.1 and won't permanent root successfully.

== BML Partition Map Definition ==
Discovered using Binwalk
