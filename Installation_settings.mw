{{note|WIP reference related to on-device installer {{issue|463|pmaports}}}}

During or right after the installation of an operating system, it makes sense to ask the user a few questions for some basic configuration. In postmarketOS, this configuration is done in <code>pmbootstrap init</code>. A graphical frontend for pmbootstrap will likely just ask the same questions. This document is about defining what pmbootstrap asks versus what we want to ask the user in an on-device installer.

Questions that do not make sense outside of pmbootstrap, such as the path to the work dir or the ccache size are not listed here.
