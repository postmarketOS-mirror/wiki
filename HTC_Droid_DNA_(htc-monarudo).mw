== Contributors ==

* Ross Schulman

== Current Status ==

* Kernel builds
* Trying to boot the kernel with <code>fastboot boot ...</code> freezes the phone, as does using <code>pmbootstrap.py flasher boot</code>
* Trying to flash the kernel with <code>pmboostrap.py flasher flash_system</code> or <code>flash_kernel</code> results in a <code>remote:not allowed</code> error, although this may be related to a corrupted partition table on my particular device.

== What works ==

* Nothing yet

== What have I tried so far ==

* Pulling flash offsets from two different dlx ROMS. Both match each other and what we're using.
* <code>adb push</code>ing the .img file and attempting to use <code>dd</code> to write into the system partition. Only succeeded in mangling the partition.
* Reflashing CM-12 just to be sure that the phone isn't totally bricked, but CM installs just fine and boots properly.

== Some theories ==

* Ross Schulman's particular HTC Droid DNA is individually broken and/or not unlocked properly (but see the ability to flash and boot multiple different CyanogenMod versions)
* Somehow the offsets are incorrect (haunting feeling this is it, but numbers were taken from previously mentioned CyanogenMod boot.img)
* The dlx doesn't actually use the m7's kernel at all (this doesn't seem plausible given the number of places that have indicated it is true)
* Ross is just mis-executing commands in some fundamental ways (the most likely of the bunch)
