== How to enter flash mode ==
Hold {{Button|Volume Up}}, then connect to the PC. If done right, blue LED will show up.

== Installation ==
I use Android recovery package, however it works if flash by Fastboot

To install:

pmbootstrap build linux-sony-sumire
pmbootstrap build device-sony-sumire
pmbootstrap install --android-recovery-zip
pmbootstrap flasher --method=adb sideload
Then put your device into recovery, and enter sideloading mode.
