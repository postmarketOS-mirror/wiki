== How to enter flash mode ==
'''bq-paella:'''
* '''Recovery''': Power on the device with both <code>Power</code> and <code>Volume Down</code> buttons.
* '''Stock fastboot''': Power on the device with both <code>Power</code> and <code>Volume Up</code> buttons.
* '''lk2nd Fastboot''': Power on the device. After it vibrates, hold <code>Volume Down</code>.

== Installation ==
'''bq-picmt:'''

By now the way I flashed the device and having it working was following [[Installation from recovery mode]] guide and using the adb sideload method

'''bq-paella:'''

# Install [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd lk2nd] following the [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd#building Building] section (just needed the first time)
# boot to lk2nd and follow the [[Installation_guide]] (tested <code>pmbootstrap flasher ..</code> and <code>fastboot</code> methods)

== Status ==
Currently work is separated based on firmware installed, if you installed the Cyanogen Edition firmware will be referred as bq-paella, if you installed the BQ Android firmware it will be referred as bq-picmt. So here is a summary for both:

'''bq-picmt:''' runs on downstream kernel

Works:
USB Network,
WiFi,
Display,
weston,
weston-calibrator

Buggy:
ts_calibrate: to make screen get touches I incrementally have to touch screen with one finger and then with that finger on screen touch the crosshair, then for the second two fingers and crosshair, for the third three fingers and crosshair...don't know why but it started happening when I replaced my broken screen with a new one, if someone has this device with original screen can check if the same issue is present or not

Modem doesn't work, in dmesg I get DATA5_CNTL error relative to no such device

'''bq-paella:''' runs on mainline kernel

Works:
USB Network,
WiFi,
Bluetooth,
Display,
Touchscreen,
Volume buttons
