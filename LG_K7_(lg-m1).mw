== Contributors ==
* bug

== What works ==
* compiling
* flashing
* booting
* ssh

* Touchscreen

I'm using the T-Mobile LG-K330 variant of the M1 with TheOddTaco kernel. There are a bunch of variants and a bunch of kernels and it's unclear to me how they're all related

== How to enter flash mode ==
* run "adb reboot bootloader" from a terminal

<!--
== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->
