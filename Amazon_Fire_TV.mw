== How to enter flash mode ==

Unlock the bootloader according to this guide: http://www.aftvnews.com/how-to-fully-unlock-the-amazon-fire-tv-bootloader/

Then you can use fastboot to flash and boot images.  A USB A-to-A cable is needed to connect a PC for fastboot.  I made a dongle by soldering two USB A connectors I salvaged from scrap cables together, then used a USB extension cable with it.

I have not tested the postmarketOS flash tool.

== Installation ==

Upload root filesystem to the partition of your choice using fastboot.  I chose the userdata partition since it doesn't replace the default Android installation and has the most space.

Test the boot.img with fastboot, then if it works flash it to the boot partition.

== Notes ==

* The FireTV has serial port pads on the bottom side of the PCB.  You can solder to them with a fine tipped soldering iron.  There is no external serial port available.

* The FireTV only has one USB port.  It is a type A port, but it can be used as a client through an A-to-A adapter.  This allows Fastboot usage.

* Wireless LAN is a USB device - Qualcomm Atheros 0CF3:9374 (ath6kl)

* Ethernet is a PCI device - Atheros L2 Ethernet Driver - version 2.2.3, PCI 0000:01:00.0 (atl1c)

* mmc0 is the EMMC - M8G1GC 7.28GB
