USB Internet
Enable Internet on your device by using a usb cable (when wifi does not work).

On your phone:

X are your pc usb ip address last numbers you will find in your pc's network manager.

sudo route add default gw 172.16.42.x 

sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf

Delete and write instead your router ip address (nameserver 192.168.1.1) or dns server address (nameserver 8.8.8.8) 

On your pc:

echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward > /dev/null

sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT

sudo iptables -A POSTROUTING -t nat -j MASQUERADE -s 172.16.42.0/24

You are done! Now try to ping someone!
