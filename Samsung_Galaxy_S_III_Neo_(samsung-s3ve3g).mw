== What works ==
* Flash Kernel (<code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</code>)
* Flash Rootfs (<code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs</code>)
* Initramfs boot
* USB Network with internet
* SSH Connectivity 
* Framebuffer graphics (Splash screens)
* Touchscreen
* Xwayland
* Weston on framebuffer
* Firefox on Weston (Xwayland)

== What does not work ==
* Everything else was untested

== How to enter flash mode ==
Press and hold {{button|Volume Down}} + {{button|Power}} simultaneously. Then click {{button|Volume Up}} to confirm.

== How to enter recovery mode ==
Press and hold {{button|Volume Up}} + {{button|Power}} simultaneously.

== Installation ==
First, [[Installing_pmbootstrap|install pmbootstrap]].

Setup device to be used:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap init
...
Vendor [samsung]: samsung          <- enter this
Device codename [s3ve3g]: s3ve3g   <- enter this
User interface [weston]:           <- choose any UI by your preference
...
</source>

Build the rootfs image:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap install
</source>

Then in order to flash it put your device in download mode, and plug it in USB. Then do:

<source lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs

 Hold "Volume down" + "Home" buttons at the end of the process,
 so that when phone reboots put it in flashing mode again 

$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel 

 This time, don't hold any button, let it reboot to Linux!
</source>

Booting from SD card also works:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap install --sdcard=/dev/sdg

 Remember to change device /dev/sd* to your card reader

$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel
</source>

== Additional info ==
Phone is booting fine. When in charging mode it shows postmarketOS charging error splash screen. 

* Back flashlight:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ echo 255 > /sys/devices/leds-qpnp-rgb-e1d8be00/leds/white/brightness # turn on
$ echo 0 > /sys/devices/leds-qpnp-rgb-e1d8be00/leds/white/brightness   # turn off
</source>

== Issues ==
* charging-sdl is broken on this device.
