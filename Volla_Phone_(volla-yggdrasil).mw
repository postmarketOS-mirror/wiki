== How to enter flash mode ==
* '''Fastboot:''' Power on the device with both {{Button|Power}}  and {{Button|Volume Up}} buttons held down. Then select ''Fastboot'' by pressing {{Button|Volume Up}} and confirm with {{Button|Volume Down}}.
* '''Recovery:''' Do the same as for ''Fastboot'', but select the ''Recovery'' option in the menu instead.
* '''MediaTek Preloader:''' The preloader triggers automatically everytime the phone turns on or reboots.

== Installation ==
<code>fastboot boot</code>ing is broken on this device, so kernels will always have to be flashed to the <code>boot</code> partition of the device.
