[https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon-processors-410 MSM8916]/[https://www.qualcomm.com/products/apq8016e APQ8016] (or Snapdragon 410) is Qualcomm SoC released in 2014, with great mainline support orginally added for the [https://www.96boards.org/product/dragonboard410c/ Dragonboard 410c].

== Audio ==
=== PulseAudio ===
Audio should work out of the box with PulseAudio. In your favorite PulseAudio mixer (e.g. <code>pulsemixer</code> on the command line) you can select the output port to use (e.g. Speaker, Earpiece, ...).

=== ALSA ===
Everything is muted by default and must be enabled through alsaucm. Unfortunately, the tool is not very user-friendly.

 $ alsaucm -i -c hw:0
 set _verb HiFi
 set _enadev <device>

where <code><device></code> is one of <code>Speaker</code>, <code>Earpiece</code>, <code>Headphones</code>, <code>PrimaryMic</code>, <code>HeadsetMic</code> or <code>SecondaryMic</code>.
alsaucm does not track which devices are already enabled, therefore it is possible to produce combinations that won't work properly (e.g. <code>Headphones</code>+<code>Earpiece</code>). To switch between devices, the old device first needs to be re-enabled and then disabled:

 $ alsaucm -i -c hw:0
 set _verb HiFi
 set _enadev OLD
 set _disdev OLD
 set _enadev NEW

{{note|'''Warning:''' alsaucm sets the volume to maximum by default. It is possible to increase the volume even further, however, this may lead to permanent damage to your speaker!}}
