[https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon-processors-410 MSM8916]/[https://www.qualcomm.com/products/apq8016e APQ8016] (or Snapdragon 410) is Qualcomm SoC released in 2014, with great mainline support orginally added for the [https://www.96boards.org/product/dragonboard410c/ Dragonboard 410c].

== Audio ==
=== PulseAudio ===
Audio should work out of the box with PulseAudio. In your favorite PulseAudio mixer (e.g. <code>pulsemixer</code> on the command line) you can select the output port to use (e.g. Speaker, Earpiece, ...).

=== ALSA ===
Everything is muted by default and must be enabled through alsaucm. Unfortunately, the tool is not very user-friendly.

 $ alsaucm -i -c hw:0
 set _verb HiFi
 set _enadev <device>

where <code><device></code> is one of <code>Speaker</code>, <code>Earpiece</code>, <code>Headphones</code>, <code>Mic1</code>, <code>Mic2</code> or <code>Headset</code>.
alsaucm does not track which devices are already enabled, therefore it is possible to produce combinations that won't work properly (e.g. <code>Headphones</code>+<code>Earpiece</code>). To switch between devices, the old device first needs to be re-enabled and then disabled:

 $ alsaucm -i -c hw:0
 set _verb HiFi
 set _enadev OLD
 set _disdev OLD
 set _enadev NEW

{{note|'''Warning:''' alsaucm sets the volume to maximum by default. It is possible to increase the volume even further, however, this may lead to permanent damage to your speaker!}}

== Modem ==
To use the modem, select the <code>mainline-modem</code> kernel instead of <code>mainline</code>, and make sure to agree to the usage of non-free firmware (required for the modem).

Note that this changes the way audio is routed on the device:
* Without modem, audio is routed directly to the audio hardware, and works without the need for non-free firmware.
* With modem running, audio must be routed through the audio DSP, which requires non-free firmware.

Therefore you should choose the kernel depending whether or not you would like to run the modem.

=== Usage ===
At the moment, the modem is primarily tested using the oFono test scripts:

 # apk add py-dbus
 $ git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/ofono/ofono.git/
 $ cd ofono/test
 $ ./enable-modem
 $ ./online-modem
 $ ./list-modems

Check if the SIM card shows up. If you have a dual SIM device (e.g. [[Wileyfox_Swift_(wileyfox-crackling)|Wileyfox Swift]]), follow [https://gist.github.com/TravMurav/45a705f210125858ce889b06f90656d9 this guide]. (TODO: Maybe move this here or somewhere else?)

Unlock the SIM card:
 ./enter-pin pin <pin>

Eventually, your SIM card should show up as registering in <code>./list-modems</code>

=== SMS ===
Use the <code>send-sms</code> and <code>receive-sms</code> test scripts (the latter requires <code>py3-gobject3</code>).
