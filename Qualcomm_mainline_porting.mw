== Prerequisites ==
* A working device-tree based downstream kernel
* You know the location of the uart port on your device ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aedd8SUBgY this video] shows how to find it)
* A device that has one of the following snapdragon processors
** S3
** S4 Pro
** 800
** 801
** 805
** 410
** 808
** 810
** 820

== Relevant chat log ==
Thanks to opendata and bshah for the following log. Let's make this more wiki friendly once we try it out.
* Copy fairphone2 DTs and change device info
** (alas, if you are using Nexus 4, apq8064 based device would be good start i.e Nexus 7(?)) 
*** Not sure about 8064, I would do the same thing but base off yuga
* msm8974-regulator.dtsi in devices android kernel tree look for a file named this 
* Look for pm8841_s1: regulator-s1 then look at the voltages and make sure your DTS is the same, if not change it. Do this for pm8841_s1: regulator-s1 - s4 and pm8941_s1: regulator-s1 - pm8841_l24: regulator-l24 
* Then look in your devices android DTSi and look for any regulator configs if you find any change the corresponding regulator in the dts 
* This should be enough to boot with USB telnet
