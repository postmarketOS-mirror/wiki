{{note|Work in progress and untested. Please improve this page (or merge it together with the non-Qualcomm-specific [[The Mainline Kernel|mainlining wiki page]]) when you try any of this.}}
== Prerequisites ==
* A working device-tree based downstream kernel
* You know the location of the UART port on your device ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aedd8SUBgY video tutorial] | [http://www.devttys0.com/2012/11/reverse-engineering-serial-ports/ Identifying serial ports])
* A device that has one of the following Snapdragon processors
** '''S3''' (MSM8260 / MSM8660)
** '''S4 Pro''' (MSM8960T / MSM8960DT / APQ8064)
** '''410''' (MSM8916 / APQ8016)
** '''800''' (MSM8974)
** '''801''' (MSM8974AA / MSM8974AB / MSM8974AC / APQ8074AB)
** '''805''' (APQ8084)
** '''808''' (MSM8992)
** '''810''' (MSM8994)
** '''820''' (MSM8996)

== Relevant chat log ==
Thanks to opendata and bshah for the following log. Let's make this more wiki friendly once we try it out.
* Copy fairphone2 DTs and change device info
** (alas, if you are using Nexus 4, apq8064 based device would be good start i.e Nexus 7(?)) 
*** Not sure about 8064, I would do the same thing but base off yuga
* Look for a file named <code>msm8974-regulator.dtsi</code> in devices android kernel tree
* Look for <code>pm8841_s1: regulator-s1</code> then look at the voltages and make sure your DTS is the same, if not change it.
* Do the same operation for the other regulators:
**<code>pm8841_s2: regulator-s2</code>
**<code>pm8841_s3: regulator-s3</code>
**<code>pm8841_s4: regulator-s4</code>
**<code>pm8941_s1: regulator-s1</code>
**<code>pm8941_s2: regulator-s2</code>
**<code>pm8941_s3: regulator-s3</code>
**<code>...</code>
**<code>pm8941_l1: regulator-l1</code>
**<code>...</code>
**<code>pm8941_l24: regulator-l24</code>
* Then look in your devices android DTSi and look for any regulator configs if you find any change the corresponding regulator in the dts 
* This should be enough to boot with USB telnet
