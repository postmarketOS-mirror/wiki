== How to enter flash mode ==
In order to be in flash mode (or download mode) press Volume Down + Power buttons simultaneously. Press Volume Up button to confirm.

== Installation ==
Flashing using heimdall is currently untested so the only way for now is to make a recovery zip using <code>pmbootstrap install --android-recovery-zip</code> and <code>pmbootstrap export</code> and install it using a custom recovery (like TWRP).

== What works ==
* USB Networking
* Booting

== What doesn't work ==
* Everything else

== Not tested ==
* Everything else
