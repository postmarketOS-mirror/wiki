== What is the GPE Palmtop Environment? ==

The GPE Palmtop Environment is a GTK+-based user interface for PDA devices. It's similar to OPIE (The Open Palmtop Integrated Environment) or QtMoko. GPE is designed to be extremely lightweight and small in size.

However, the last version of Debian that shipped the suite was Wheezy. The project appears to have suffered from a lack of maintainers, a trademark and copyright spat between the handhelds.org website and linuxtogo website, as well as very slow development. 

The GPE code is entirely unmaintained and has dependencies which are unmaintained, for instance SQLite versions from around 2005.
It also has its main configuration program running as setuid root, which presents quite a large attack surface for a simple program.
It also depended on non-standard components such as /etc/timezone (this is not portable to systems not based on Debian, let alone
POSIX-compliant Unix-like systems). 

Additionally, certain libraries, that the suite depends on, ship with some terrible security issues, for instance old versions of sqlite.

The most immediate problems, however are with compiling the thing. There are simple issues with config.sub in the autoconf build system in many of the packages not understanding Alpine Linux's triples or any triple including the form "musl" or "armv6". There are more serious problems such as some of the packages not linking properly. This was the main problem in the end.

Another immediate problem is that the homepage for GPE is now gone. The source code archives that were used came from Debian. They appear to be the latest - they shipped with Debian Wheezy, which came out in May 2013.

|-
! scope="row"| gpe-beam
| Not ported
| N/A
| N/A
| IrDa file transfer tool
| This is very niche and there are very few devices currently in PMOS that support IR transfer (the only one that comes to mind is the LG G3 which had an IR blaster, but it is unknown if this would work).
|-

| Modern programs exist for bluetooth transfer. It is unknown as to whether this program would still work.
|-
! scope="row"| gpe-bootsplash
| Not ported

| N/A
| A boot splash screen. 
| Not suitable for PMOS, as we already have a boot splash screen which offers more functionality.
|-
! scope="row"| gpe-calculator/gpe-calculator2
| Not ported
| N/A
| N/A
| Calculator program for GPE
| This would perhaps be useful to have, but galculator is already packaged, which is at least as fully-featured.
|-
! scope="row"| gpe-calendar
| Ported
| gpe-calendar
| 0.92
| Calendar application for GPE
| A useful and lightweight calendar application. However, gpe-contacts does not currently work, so it may be missing any associated functionality.
|-
! scope="row"| gpe-clock
| Does not work
| N/A
| N/A
| Clock application for GPE
| The program does work on PMOS due to not using /etc/timezone like Debian. We can work around this using a script to populate /etc/timezone, or it may be necessary to rewrite the timezone functionality altogether.
|-
! scope="row"| gpe-dm
| Not ported
| N/A

|-

| gpe-icons
| 0.25
| Basic icon set for GPE

| N/A
| N/A
| Login screen for GPE
| It is packaged, but it does not build or link properly, and it appears non-trivial to fix. Not really needed, if we use a generic display manager instead (this is more desirable; unknown if gpe-login allows logging in to arbitrary user interfaces).
|-
! scope="row"| gpe-mini-browser

| Not ported
| N/A
| N/A
| Audio mixer frontend for GPE
| If we switch GPE to use PulseAudio instead, this becomes defunct (PulseAudio volume control program has plugins for panels and is very usable). As such, unlikely to port this.

| N/A
| Sketchbook program for GPE
| A useful and fun application for PDAs. Well worth porting as it is not as complicated and heavy as, say, GIMP or InkScape. There are slightly larger programs such as mtpaint that are also useful.

|-
! scope="row"| gpe-appmgr

! scope="row"| matchbox-window-manager-2
| Not ported
| N/A
| N/A
| X environment for resource-limited systems
| Matchbox is useful for PDAs as it only displays one window at a time, and the panel is stylus-friendly. Similarly it scales well for small displays. So it is worth porting it (at the time of writing, matchbox-keyboard is already packaged) either as a single package or as each separate component packaged.

== Going forward ==

Porting GPE would be probably not be worth it, as it is wholly unmaintained and would need an audit, or, even better, a full rewrite. That being said, it would still be useful to finish porting certain components:

=== Priorities ===

* Fix dependency on that ancient sqlite version. It should not be too difficult to rewrite, however, the old functions cannot always be subsituted directly for the equivalent new sqlite3 function.
* Fix dependency on the enlightened sound daemon, and on the audiofile library. PulseAudio should probably replace this.
* Make certain programs link properly.
* Fix security bugs.

== What about OPIE and others? ==

=== OPIE ===
OPIE is an alternative to GPE. It's similarly targeted at embedded systems and is similar in function. However, it uses QT Extended (QTE), which is no longer under active development, and does not compile on more recent systems, let alone under Musl.

* [https://github.com/opieproject/opie OPIE Project]

=== QTMoko ===
Another alternative is QTMoko. QTMoko is similar to OPIE but they forked QTE and now use a custom patched version of QT (Itself unmaintained). QTMoko is the fork of QTE for OpenMoko handsets. They are looking into moving away from this in the future, though, so this is probably a viable alternative.

* [https://www.mail-archive.com/gta04-owner@goldelico.com/ Main conversation about QTMoko for GTA04 owners]
* [https://www.mail-archive.com/gta04-owner@goldelico.com/msg00853.html Message about QTMoko potentially moving away from QTE]
* [http://projects.goldelico.com/p/gta04-qtmoko/ Maintained QTMoko (now at version 2)]

=== SHR ===
SHR is an OpenEmbedded-based system which combines Enlightenment with the freesmartphone stack, among other things. They use the illume2 Enlightenment module to make Enlightenment fit handhelds' form factor more easily, and provide an on-screen keyboard.

* [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/SHR SHR overview]
* [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/SHR_User_Manual SHR user manual]

A thought: It would be useful to port Enlightenment to Alpine at any rate. It can work as an X11 window manager or as a Wayland compositor, and it is used for instance by Tizen. However, it's codebase is "interesting", particularly the EFL libraries.
