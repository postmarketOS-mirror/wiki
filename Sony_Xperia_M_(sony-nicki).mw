== What works ==
- Boot

- USB Network (ssh and tethering)

- Display (with a workaround script)

- Touchscreen

- XFCE4

- Weston

- MATE

- osk-sdl

== What does not work ==
- Plasma

- Wifi

- Modem

- GPS

- Audio

- Camera

- 3D

- Sensors

- Notification LED

- charging-sdl // technically it shows up and shows (probably) accurate percentage yet the display won't go off after charger disconnect

== How to enter flash mode ==
With device powered off, hold [VOLUME +] and plug USB cable in. Device's LED will turn blue, meaning it has entered fastboot mode.

== Installation ==
Works with both pmbootstrap flasher and TWRP zip. No errors were found in that process.

If using a large rootfs (like with plasma-mobile) fastboot with throw a "no space left on device" error. Flashing as a .zip with TWRP solves the problem.
