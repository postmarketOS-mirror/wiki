== How to enter flash mode ==
With device powered off, hold [VOLUME +] and plug USB cable in. Device's LED will turn blue, meaning it has entered fastboot mode.

== Installation ==
Works with both pmbootstrap flasher and TWRP zip. No errors were found in that process.

If using a large rootfs (like with plasma-mobile) fastboot with throw a "no space left on device" error. Flashing as a .zip with TWRP solves the problem.
