Xfce4 is a GTK-based [[User-Interfaces|desktop environment]] aiming to be fast and lightweight.<br>

== Status ==

It works on most devices with a working display, and runs fine without hardware acceleration. Uses latest xfce version packages from Alpine repo.

== Installation ==
* <code>pmbootstrap init</code>
* <code>User interface: xfce4</code>
* <code>Extra packages: xf86-video-vesa mesa-egl</code>
** Add <code>matchbox-keyboard</code>[https://postmarketos.org/static/img/2017-12/xfce4-i9505.jpg] or <code>corekeyboard</code> [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/images/8/83/Corekeyboard.jpg] to get an on-screen keyboard 

== Fixes ==

# Follow the [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Display Display] guide to change and fix display related issues.
# Add <code>gvfs</code> and <code>thunar-volman</code> for mounting drives and drive management.
# Change the scaling settings to 2x in <code>Applications/Settings/Appearance/Settings/Window Scaling</code> setting.
# Install <code>lxdm</code> to get restart options in power manager.
# Disable <code>Compositor</code> from <code>Window Manager Tweaks</code> in settings to get faster experience.


== Better usability ==

The best way to use the Xfce will be in Horizontally. So do this step to get better usability from Xfce.
* Rotate the display and touch to horizontal using [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Display Display] guide.
* In panel setting, change the mode to <code>Deskbar</code>, add <code>wisker-menu</code> and remove other plugins.
* In <code>FileManager</code> settings, shortcut pane icon size to 48 px and enable <code>Single Click</code> in Behavior section.
* Use [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/CoreApps CoreApps] as they work best in Horizontal screens.






== Improving Touchscreen-Friendliness ==

In <code>Window Manager</code> settings, changing the theme to <code>Default-hdpi</code> or <code>Default-xhdpi</code> will make window buttons and title bars larger. A font size of about 16 can work well with these themes.

In <code>Panel</code> settings, increasing panel height, and setting panels to hide <code>Intelligently</code>, will make them easier to interact with, without losing effective screen real estate.

This results in something like the right. The only obvious problem is the large, permanent, title bars.
