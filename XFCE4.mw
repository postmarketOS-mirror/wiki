Xfce4 is a GTK-based [[User-Interfaces|desktop environment]] aiming to be fast and lightweight.<br>

== Status ==

It works on most devices with a working display, and runs fine without hardware acceleration. Uses packages from Alpine repo.

== Installation ==
* <code>pmbootstrap init</code>
* <code>User interface: xfce4</code>
* <code>Extra packages: xf86-video-vesa mesa-egl</code>
** Add <code>matchbox-keyboard</code> to get an on-screen keyboard [https://postmarketos.org/static/img/2017-12/xfce4-i9505.jpg]

== Guide ==

Follow the [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Display Display] guide to change and fix display related issues.

==Improving Touchscreen-Friendliness==

In <code>Window Manager</code> settings, changing the theme to <code>Default-hdpi</code> or <code>Default-xhdpi</code> will make window buttons and title bars larger. A font size of about 16 can work well with these themes.

In <code>Panel</code> settings, increasing panel height, and setting panels to hide <code>Intelligently</code>, will make them easier to interact with, without losing effective screen real estate.

This results in something like the right. The only obvious problem is the large, permanent, title bars.
