Xfce4 is pretty usable on Nokia N900.

=== Installation ===
* <code>pmbootstrap init</code>
* Select <code>xfce4</code> as user interface

=== How the config was made ===

pmbootstrap.py init
User interface: xfce4
Extra packages: xf86-video-vesa mesa-egl libinput xf86-input-libinput

Log in as user, then startxfce4

applications| settings| windowmanager
Default-xhdpi
Font ... 16?

settings|panels, panel1, hide panel inteligently, 53 pixels.
settings|panels, panel2, hide panel inteligently.

With configuration above, you get this. Only obvious problem is waste of space at top of the screen.
