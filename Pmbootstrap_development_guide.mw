=== Installation code (<code>pmb.install.*</code>) ===
Whenever you change the installation process, also adjust the recovery zip installer (which performs a good part of the installation procedure directly on the Android device with a shell script).

=== What is this <code>args</code> variable used everywhere? ===
See the big comment at the top of [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/master/pmb/helpers/args.py <code>pmb/helpers/args.py</code>].

=== Executing shell commands ===
Use one of the following functions instead of Python's built in <code>subprocess</code>:

* [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/master/pmb/helpers/run.py <code>pmb.helpers.run.user()</code>]
* [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/master/pmb/helpers/run.py <code>pmb.helpers.run.root()</code>]
* [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/master/pmb/chroot/user.py <code>pmb.chroot.user()</code>]
* [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/master/pmb/chroot/root.py <code>pmb.chroot.root()</code>]

These functions call [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/master/pmb/helpers/run_core.py <code>pmb.helpers.run_core.core()</code>] internally to write to the log file (that you can read with <code>pmbootstrap log</code>) and timeout when there is no output. A lot of function parameters are passed through to <code>core()</code> as well, see its docstring for a detailed description of what these parameters do.

==== Writing to files ====
{{note|See also: {{github|1316}} Properly escape commands in pmb.chroot.user()}}
The passed commands gets interpreted as single command, and not executed in a shell. This means something like the following '''will not work''':

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
pmb.chroot.root(args, ["echo", "test", ">", "/tmp/test"])
</syntaxhighlight>

Instead, if you need shell functionality in the call, you can wrap the call with <code>sh -c</code>. Here's one example with the parameters correctly escaped (you don't need to do that for the strings in this example, but if you pass variables then they should be escaped properly):

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
shell_cmd = "echo " + shutil.quote("test") + " > " + shutil.quote("/tmp/test")
pmb.chroot.root(args, ["sh", "-c", shell_cmd])
</syntaxhighlight>

Another technique (especially if you need to run many commands in the shell at once) is writing all commands down into a temporary file and executing it with the shell, see for example [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/1c13ca4fd9e32952a8e559987f82cd0925cddee9/pmb/chroot/initfs.py#L66-L76 pmb/chroot/initfs.py].

==== Writing files to the chroot ====
The users in the chroots (root and pmos) have different user IDs than the user of the host system. Therefore we can't just write a file to anywhere in the chroot. But we can write to <code>/tmp</code> and move the file afterwards:
<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
with open("tmp/somefile", "w") as handle:
    handle.write("It works")
pmb.chroot.root(args, ["mv", "/tmp/somefile", "/etc/somefile"])
</syntaxhighlight>

=== Testing the APKBUILD parser after changes ===
Besides the python tests, it's a good idea to let the APKBUILD parsing code run over all APKBUILDs that we have in pmaports.git, before and after making changes. This makes it easy to spot regressions.

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap apkbuild_parse > /tmp/new
$ git checkout master
$ pmbootstrap apkbuild_parse > /tmp/old
$ colordiff /tmp/old /tmp/new | less -R
</syntaxhighlight>
