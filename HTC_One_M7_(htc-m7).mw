== How to enter flash mode ==
Hold volume-down and the power button until it goes into the bootloader.
If you don't already, you'll need to unlock your bootloader and install a custom recovery like TWRP.
From there, use the volume keys and the power button to select the recovery option.
In TWRP, select Advanced and then Sideload.

== Installation ==
Direct flashing doesn't seem to work (might have something to do with requiring S-OFF?) but you can create a zip and sideload it with:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap install --android-recovery-zip
$ pmbootstrap flasher --method=adb sideload
</source>

== Notes ==
Not much has been tested yet.
Screen can be made functioning with
<source lang="shell-session">
$ echo 100 > /sys/devices/platform/msm_fb.590593/leds/lcd-backlight/brightness
$ cat /sys/devices/virtual/graphics/fb0/modes > /sys/devices/virtual/graphics/fb0/mode
</source>
