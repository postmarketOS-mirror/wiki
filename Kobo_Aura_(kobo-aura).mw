<!--== What works ==-->

== What does not work ==
Kernel compilation. The lowest working kernel for postmarketOS is 3.x, while the kobo-aura uses a fork of 2.6. 

== Notes ==
* Maybe possible to diff changes between official 2.6 kernel and kobo's fork, create patch, and apply to 3.x to create working kernel? Working on this
* Newer kobo devices might run 3.0? Unsure.
