== What works ==

* Kernel compiles
* Can be flashed with fastboot (small system image required, requires <code>0x1949</code> as deviceinfo_flash_fastboot_vendor_id), or TWRP terminal
* Boots successfully
* Weston
* SSH/RNDIS

== Problems ==

* TWRP for this device does NOT contain busybox
* fastboot cannot flash larger images (512 MB or above), it will error with <code>FAILED Unknown chunk type</code>. The latest pmbootstrap should warn you about this.
* Wifi doesn't work

== How to enter flash mode ==

'''Fastboot''': Hold down POWER and VOL DOWN   

'''Recovery''': Hold down POWER and VOL UP until the silver "Kindle Fire" shows up. Then let go of POWER.

== Preparing for install ==
Unlock your bootloader and install TWRP. ''SAFESTRAP WILL NOT WORK!!'' 
 
This will automatically do it: https://forum.xda-developers.com/kindle-fire-hdx/general/multi-platform-1-click-bootloader-t3241014  
  
However, there is a manual tutorial here: https://forum.xda-developers.com/kindle-fire-hdx/general/thor-unlocking-bootloader-firmware-t3463982

== Installation ==
(TWRP)
A recovery image can be flashed via TWRP normally

(Fastboot)
Fastboot also works, however please note that images that are 510+ MB cannot be flashed via Fastboot. Use netcat or recovery.
