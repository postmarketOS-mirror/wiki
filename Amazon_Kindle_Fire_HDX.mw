== How to enter flash mode ==

'''Fastboot''': Hold down POWER and VOL DOWN   

'''Recovery''': Hold down POWER and VOL UP until the silver "Kindle Fire" shows up. Then let go of POWER.

== Preparing for install ==
Unlock your bootloader and install TWRP. ''SAFESTRAP WILL NOT WORK!!'' 
 
This will automatically do it: https://forum.xda-developers.com/kindle-fire-hdx/general/multi-platform-1-click-bootloader-t3241014  
  
However, there is a manual tutorial here: https://forum.xda-developers.com/kindle-fire-hdx/general/thor-unlocking-bootloader-firmware-t3463982

== Installation ==
(TWRP)
Copy <code>amazon-thor.img</code> and <code>boot.img</code> to the sdcard, along with a file called <code>flash.sh</code> that contains

<code>
dd if=amazon-thor.img of=/dev/block/platform/msm_sdcc.1/by-name/system bs=1M;   
dd if=boot.img of=/dev/block/platform/msm_sdcc.1/by-name/boot bs=1M</code>

Open up TWRP on your device, and do the following, IN ORDER:
* Wipe all your partitions (including System, Data, and Internal Storage!)
* Reboot > Recovery
* Mount > ensure System is unchecked
* Go to the terminal, and do <code>cd /sdcard</code>, and then <code>sh flash.sh</code>
