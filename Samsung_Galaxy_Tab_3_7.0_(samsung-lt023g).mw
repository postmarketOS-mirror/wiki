== Entering flash mode ==
* Power down the device, then press and hold <code>Volume Down</code> + <code>Home</code> + <code>Power</code> simultaneously.
* Once the device vibrates, release <code>Power</code>, but keep <code>Volume Down</code> and <code>Home</code> held.
* The device will ask you if you wish to upload a custom OS. Press <code>Volume Up</code> to confirm.
* Once the device displays &quot;Odin mode&quot; in the top-left of the screen, it is ready for flashing.

== Entering recovery mode ==
* Power down the device, then press and hold <code>Volume Up</code> + <code>Home</code> + <code>Power</code> simultaneously.
* Once the device vibrates, release <code>Power</code>, but keep <code>Volume Up</code> and <code>Home</code> held.

== Installing the kernel ==
This can be done via <code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</code> after [[#Entering flash mode|entering flash mode]].

== What works ==
* Booting off a microSD card
* Booting from system partition using Android recovery option
* Display
* Touchscreen
* USB networking
* Full disk encryption
* Physical buttons
* Touch keys
* Backlight brightness
* Battery indicator
* Wayland
* X11
* Front Camera(and probably back but didn't figure out how to switch cameras)
* WiFi
* Sensors
* Bluetooth(only shows available devices. Still looking for a way to connect to a device)

== What does not work ==
* Cellular networking
* 2D and 3D Acceleration
* Audio
Everything else is untested as of writing this.

== How hpagseddy get camera working ==
Right now it's not usable for daily use, just for testing camera quality and checking if camera is working or not. I used "motion" package from alpine linux to capture pictures. If you want to test it too, just use "apk add motion" command to install that package. Then simply type "motion" and it will start capturing pictures nearly every second. If it doesn't capture pictures or pictures are just black squares then your camera isn't working. For opening pictures, i used feh image viewer to view images but every gallery app works great.

== How to get WiFi working ==
Install <code>linux-firmware-mrvl</code> to get the necessary firmware files, reboot the device after install.
Run <code>sudo ifconfig mlan0 up</code>, then configure <code>wpa_supplicant</code>:
<pre>$ wpa_passphrase YOUR_SSID YOUR_PASSPHRASE | sudo tee /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
</pre>
Then run:
<pre>
sudo rc-service wpa_supplicant start
sudo udhcpc -i mlan0
</pre>
Note: You need to turn rndis0 off using <code>sudo ifconfig rndis0 down</code> if you used USB Internet. Also remove usb_internet.start from <code>/etc/local.d</code>.
If starting the service didn't work, start wpa_supplicant manually with: 
<pre>
sudo wpa_supplicant -u -Dnl80211 -B -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -imlan0
</pre>
You might need to kill the existing process if the wpa_supplicant service fails to start (find it for example with htop).

== About GPU ==
The GPU is Vivante GC1000 which has open source drivers but we can't get it work yet. The reverse engineered driver is called etnaviv and the compiling process is a little bit complex. If anyone figures it out dont forget to tag @hpagseddy at postmarketos matrix server. Galaxy tab 4 7.0 have same GPU, and plasma mobile seems to work better with hw acceleration, but OpenGL is failing.
