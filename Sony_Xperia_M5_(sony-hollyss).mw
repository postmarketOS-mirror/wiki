== How to enter flash mode ==
You will need to be in TWRP. From powered off, hold Vol Down + Power.

== Notes ==
- I doubt it will be able to be mainlined by myself as I (empyreal96) am not developer level but I am learning!

== Installation ==
I only had success with the Flashable Zip method using 'pmbootstrap flasher --method=adb sideload' or 'adb sideload PATH_TO_ZIP'

You may recieve errors that it is unable to format partitions, make sure they are NOT mounted in TWRP before sideloading.

If you need to flash back to android, go to (Wipe - Advanced Wipe - Tick System - Repair or Change.. - Change Filesystem - ext4) because TWRP will fail to see the partition
