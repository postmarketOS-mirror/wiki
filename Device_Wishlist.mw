We have been asked, which devices we would like to see pmOS running on - by people who might specifically buy them (with broken screens etc, to get them cheaper) to help the project. Please list devices here, that you would like to see pmOS running on. Do not list devices, that we already have a port for, or specify a reason why you do.
