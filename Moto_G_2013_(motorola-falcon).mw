There appears to be no special process to flashing the device, as long as the bootloader is unlocked first. Sadly there is no official way any more to unlock it.

Once you're in fastboot by holding down {{Button|Volume Down}} + {{Button|Power}}, flashing it is as follows:

<source lang="bash">
$ pmbootstrap init
$ pmbootstrap install
$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs
$ pmbootstrap flasher boot 
</source>

You can also use <code> $ pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</code> to flash the kernel, however this breaks the charging splash screen

== Useful stuff ==

Similar to the [[Moto_G_2014_(motorola-titan)|Moto G 2014]], the LED can be controlled:

<source lang="bash">$ echo 255 > /sys/devices/leds-qpnp-rgb-e1dba000/leds/white/brightness</source>
