== What works ==

* Device boots
* Framebuffer graphics
* Splashscreen
* Weston
* Touchscreen
* Flashing the kernel and system image via fastboot
 
== What doesn't work ==

* Anything not mentioned (wifi, bluetooth, etc.)

== Untested ==

* Interfaces other than weston
* Using full disk encryption 

== Installing ==

There appears to be no special process to flashing the device, as long as [https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/standalone/bootloader/unlock-your-device-a/ the bootloader is unlocked first]

Once you're in fastboot by holding down vol down and power, flashing it is as follows:

<source lang="bash">
$ pmbootstrap init
$ pmbootstrap install --no-fda
$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_system
$ pmbootstrap flasher boot 
</source>

You can also use <code> $ pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</code> to flash the kernel, however this breaks the charging splash screen

== Useful stuff ==

Similar to the [[Moto_G_2014_(motorola-titan)|Moto G 2014]], the LED can be controlled:

<source lang="bash">$ echo 255 > /sys/devices/leds-qpnp-rgb-e1dba000/leds/white/brightness</source>
