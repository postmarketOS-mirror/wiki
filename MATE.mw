MATE is a [[User-Interfaces|desktop environment]] forked from the maintained code base of GNOME 2.  It is installable on postmarketOS.<br>

== Status ==

It works on most devices with a working display, works fine without hardware acceleration. Also it has Hi-Dpi support. So apps will look better and usable. Use packages from Alpine repo.

After the postmarketOS loading splashscreen you will get a black screen for 20-30 seconds before the desktop appears.
This seems due to an issue with <code>marco</code> (MATE window manager):
<pre>
mate-session[1377]: WARNING: Application 'marco.desktop' failed to register before timeout
</pre>

== Install MATE Desktop ==

Run <code>pmbootstrap init</code> and choose <code>mate</code> in the interface section.
The Alpine repository already contains all the packages for x86_64, armhf and aarch64 architectures.
Nothing has to be done to enable it.

After installation, the shell will automatically launch upon boot. If it doesn't, have a look at <code>/etc/profile.d/start_mate.sh</code> script.

For the official MATE instructions, see [https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/MATE their website].

== Guide ==

Follow the [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Display Display] guide to change and fix display related issues.
