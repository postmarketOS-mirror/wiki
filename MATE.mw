MATE is a [[User-Interfaces|desktop environment]] forked from the maintained code base of GNOME 2.  It is installable on postmarketOS.<br>

== Status ==

It works on most devices with a working display, works fine without hardware acceleration.

After the postmarketOS loading splashscreen you will get a black screen for 20-30 seconds before the desktop appears.
This seems due to an issue with <code>marco</code> (MATE window manager):
<pre>
mate-session[1377]: WARNING: Application 'marco.desktop' failed to register before timeout
</pre>

== Install MATE Desktop ==
Run <code>pmbootstrap init</code> and choose <code>mate</code> in the interface section.
The Alpine repository already contains all the packages for x86_64, armhf and aarch64 architectures.
Nothing has to be done to enable it.

After installation, the shell will automatically launch upon boot. If it doesn't, have a look at <code>/etc/profile.d/start_mate.sh</code> script.

For the official MATE instructions, see [https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/MATE their website].

== Troubleshooting ==

Check the logs with <code>logread -f | grep x11</code>

== Landscape mode ==

=== Rotate the screen ===

You can rotate adding the following configuration file: <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-fbdev-rotate.conf</code>
<pre>
Section "Device"
  Identifier "LCD"
  Driver "fbdev"
  Option "Rotate" "CW"
EndSection
</pre>

=== Rotate the touchscreen ===
In order to also rotate the touchscreen you need to change the udev rule: <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/90-device-samsung-i9070.rules</code>
And add one of the following line:
<pre>
# Left - 90 degree clockwise
ENV{LIBINPUT_CALIBRATION_MATRIX}="0 -1 1 1 0 0"
# 180 degree clockwise
ENV{LIBINPUT_CALIBRATION_MATRIX}="-1 0 1 0 -1 1"
# Right - 270 degree clockwise
ENV{LIBINPUT_CALIBRATION_MATRIX}="0 1 0 -1 0 1"
# reflect along y axis
ENV{LIBINPUT_CALIBRATION_MATRIX}="-1 0 1 1 0 0"
</pre>
and reboot udev or the device.
