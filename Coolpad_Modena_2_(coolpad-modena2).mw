== Status ==

Flashing a custom kernel is not possible yet, but McBitter is working on replacing the bootloader with a custom fork of [https://github.com/littlekernel/lk LK] (a proprietary fork of LK is already present on the device, but it does not allow flashing a custom kernel). When that works, porting pmOS can begin.

Most of the time is spent on documenting Mediatek boot process in depth. This device will be used as an example.
