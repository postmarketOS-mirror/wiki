=== Compiling a kernel ===

==== LineageOS ====

* Due to the fact that the port of CyanogenMOD never went past version 11 because of a lack of maintainers, the device didn't get taken up by the continuation of CyanogenMOD (LineageOS) after it died off.
* This is the reason why we're using the old abandoned repository.
* But CyanogenMOD has a kernel: https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_kernel_asus_tf700t
* Version: 3.1.10
* Status: Untested

==== "grimlock" ====

==== "katkernel" ====
