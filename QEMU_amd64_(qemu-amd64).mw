This device is used for testing purposes. It is possible to run postmarketOS in a x86_64 Virtual Machine. QEMU will emulate the default x86_64 architecture (see <code>qemu-system-x86_64 -machine help</code> for more choices).

=== Usage ===
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap init  # Choose device "qemu-amd64"
$ pmbootstrap install --no-fde
$ pmbootstrap qemu --image-size=2G
</syntaxhighlight>

See <code>pmbootstrap qemu --help</code> for more options. Notably <code>--spice</code> uses the SPICE protocol, which may give you better 3D acceleration. The <code>--display=gtk</code> switch allows you to see the serial output, but we didn't get 3D acceleration working with it. Default output is SDL (where 3D acceleration is working for most setups).

=== What works ===
* Storage
* Network
* Keyboard and mouse
* Graphical interfaces (Weston, Plasma Mobile, ...)
* <code>osk-sdl</code> (with --spice)

=== What does not work ===
* X11 over vesa: see {{github|672}}
* <code>osk-sdl</code> segfaults without --spice
