# [[Installing_pmbootstrap | Install pmbootstrap]]
# <pre>pmbootstrap init</pre>
# <pre>pmbootstrap install --no-fde</pre>
# Put your S4 in Download Mode (Volume Down + Power) and connect it with USB
# <pre>pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</pre>
# After the kernel is flashed, the device will reboot. Hold the volume down button while it boots up to re-enter Download Mode
# <pre>pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs</pre>

== Wifi ==

Once the device has been successfully initialized, enable it:

<pre>$ sudo ip link set wlan0 up</pre>
Configure wpa_supplicant (only necessary on encrypted networks):

<pre>
$ wpa_passphrase $YOUR_SSID | sudo tee /etc/wpa_supplicant/wlan0.conf
&lt;enter passphrase here and press Enter&gt;
</pre>
Connect to network using wpa_supplicant:

<pre>$ sudo wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wlan0.conf </pre>
If your network uses DHCP, start the DHCP client:

<pre>$ sudo udhcpc -i wlan0</pre>
