== How to enter flash mode ==
With power off, press power und volume-down at the same time, with the usb-cable plugged in. 

== How to flash ==
As Huawei changed the partition layout, there is no boot partition anymore. Instead there is a ramdisk and a seperate kernel partition. In order to create the correct images the following steps need to be done:

# Get mkbootimg and unpackbootimg i.e. from [https://github.com/anestisb/android-unpackbootimg here].
# You can extract the kernel-image and ramdisk from the created boot.img with unpackbootimg. 
#:<code> <nowiki>#</nowiki> copy created boot image to current directory </code>
#:<code>cp ~/.local/var/pmbootstrap/chroot_rootfs_huawei-cameron/boot/boot.img-huawei-cameron .</code>
#:<code> <nowiki>#</nowiki> extract the created boot.img</code>
#:<code>mkdir pmos-boot-huawei-cameron</code>
#:<code>unpackbootimg -i boot.img-huawei-cameron -o pmos-boot-huawei-cameron/ </code>
#: Use the extracted files in the following steps.
# Create ramdisk image:
#:<code> <nowiki>#</nowiki> create new ramdisk image with empty kernel (empty.file size is 0) </code>
#:<code>./android-unpackbootimg/mkbootimg.py --kernel empty.file --ramdisk pmos-boot-huawei-cameron/boot.img-huawei-cameron-ramdisk.gz --cmdline 'buildvariant=user' --os_version 8.0.0 --os_patch_level 2018-06-05 -o pmos-cameron.ramdisk.img </code>
# Create kernel image:
#:<code> <nowiki>#</nowiki> kernel (with empty.file size is 0): </code>
#:<code>kbootimg.py --kernel pmos-boot-huawei-cameron/boot.img-huawei-cameron-zImage --ramdisk empty.file --cmdline 'loglevel=4 initcall_debug=y page_tracker=on slub_min_objects=16 unmovable_isolate1=2:192M,3:224M,4:256M printktimer=0xfff0a000,0x534,0x538 androidboot.selinux=enforcing buildvariant=user' --base 0x0 --kernel_offset 524288 --ramdisk_offset 130023424 --second_offset 15728640 --tags_offset 0x7a00000 --os_version 8.0.0 --os_patch_level 2018-12 -o pmos-cameron.kernel.img </code>

# Flash ramdisk and kernel with fastboot:
#:<code>fastboot flash kernel pmos-cameron.kernel.img </code>
#:<code>fastboot flash ramdisk pmos-cameron.ramdisk.img </code>

== Additional Kernel Configuration ==
=== OASES ===
==== About ====
OASES stands for Open Adaptive Security Extensions. Its a Tradmark of Baidu and seems to have something todo with adaptive kernel live-patching. For now there were no disadvantages from disabling it.

==== Location in menu ====
 <nowiki>-> Device Drivers
   -> Huawei Platform Drivers
      -> Huawei platform drivers support (HUAWEI_PLATFORM [=y]) </nowiki>
In Order to compile the kernel OASES had to be disabled. 

== Additional Info ==
The display brightness can be set by writing a value between 0 and 1024 to <code> /sys/class/leds/lcd_backlight0/brightness </code>. 
For now the backlight is completley dark when the system boots.
