=== Entering Fastboot mode ===

Turn on your watch and swipe from the top left corner (so that be where 11 would be on the watch) as soon as you see the Asus logo.

=== What works ===

* Nothing yet

=== What doesn't work ===

I've tried booting the zenwatch with the kernel for the [[LG G Watch R (lg-lenok)|LG G Watch R]] but that doesn't work. The boot image is just a bit too big (17.2MiB on a 16MiB partition) and the zenwatch wants an appended DTB.

=== Partition info ===
Boot and recovery are 16MiB
