== Installation ==
At the moment flashing is not working, so it is necessary to install to sdcard and then live boot from fastboot.

First the initialization commands are needed
<source lang="shell">
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap.git
$ cd pmbootstrap
$ ./pmbootstrap.py init
</source>
Choose 'lg-w5' as target device.

After that, installing to sdcard works with the command
<source lang="shell">
# Replace /dev/sdX with the device for your sdcard
$ ./pmbootstrap.py install --no-fde --sdcard /dev/sdX</source>

Now place the sdcard into the phone. Assuming that the bootloader is unlocked, it is possible to get to fastboot by following steps
# Disconnect and reconnect the battery.
# Hold volume up while connecting phone to computer with a usb cable.
Now it is possible to live boot <source lang="shell">$ ./pmbootstrap.py flasher boot</source>

Screen is also not yet working, so for now the only way to find out if it booted is by [[USB_Network | usb networking]].
