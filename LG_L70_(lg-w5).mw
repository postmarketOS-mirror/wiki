== Installation ==
At the moment flashing is not working, so it is necessary to install to sdcard and then live boot from fastboot.

Installing to sdcard works with the command
<source lang="shell">
# Replace /dev/sdX with the device for your sdcard
$ pmbootstrap install --no-fde --sdcard /dev/sdX</source>

Now place the sdcard into the phone. Assuming that the bootloader is unlocked, it is possible to get to fastboot by following steps
# Disconnect and reconnect the battery.
# Hold volume up while connecting phone to computer with a usb cable.
Now it is possible to live boot.
<source lang="shell">$ pmbootstrap flasher boot</source>

The screen doesn't work yet, so for now the only way to find out if it booted is by [[USB_Network | usb networking]] or the [[Troubleshooting:boot#Does_the_kernel_boot.3F | maximum attention hook]].
