== Contributors ==
* Bloo

== Basic info ==

* [http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_note_ii_n7100-4854.php more specs]
* [https://github.com/bigbiff/android_kernel_samsung_smdk4412 Unofficial TWRP kernel repo]

== What works ==

* Compiling the kernel
* Flashing with Heimdall
* Booting initramfs
* SSH
* Touch screen fully calibrated

== What does not work ==

* Sound
* Weston

== Not tested ==

* WiFi (needs kernel modules compiling first)

== How to enter flash mode ==

Press and hold &quot;volume down + home + power&quot; simultaneously. Then click volume up to confirm.

== Installing system ==

The device package and kernel is now available, pre-built, from the repositories.
<!--
First build the device package:

<source lang="shell-session">$ pmbootstrap build device-samsung-n7100</source>
<!--Then you need to configure the kernel before building with <code>menuconfig</code> like so:

<pre class="shell">./pmbootstrap.py menuconfig linux-samsung-n7100</pre>
You can hold down the enter key while it asks you the y/n questions until you get to the menu, then you want to enable the <code>DEVTMPFS</code> kconfig flag located in <code>Device Drivers ---&gt; Generic Driver Options</code>. -->

Now you want to compile the kernel itself:

<source lang="shell-session">$ pmbootstrap build linux-samsung-n7100 --arch=armhf</source>
-->

You can install the OS to an SD card or your system partition. I've only tried an SD card:

<source lang="shell-session">$ pmbootstrap install --sdcard=/dev/sdb</source>
You will need a 1GB SD card in order for this to work, also keep in mind that this will format the sd card.

Please also note, that you cannot flash directly to the system due to an error in Heimdall.

Next you want to put your phone in download mode by holding <code>power + vol down + home</code> all together until you enter download mode, press volume up again to continue past the warning.

Now you can flash the boot image:

<source lang="shell-session">$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</source>
We're using <code>flash_kernel</code> because the N7100 packages its kernel and initfs file into one boot image, where as some other phones have separate partitions for each '''unlike''' the N7100.

If everything checks out OK, your N7100 should reboot and you should see the Samsung logo. Dont worry if the screen is flashing on and off and its taking a while, after a minute or 2 it should show up the pmOS splash!

== Issues ==
* Weston does not run, presumably because of missing API calls. This should be fixed once the device runs mainline.
* The kernel seems to have a bug which causes it to reboot a large number of times. It will eventually be able to boot properly though. ([https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/rWxLNbGACqTlpXVuUZEWNQaG]) 

== Mainline Kernel ==
There is currently no mainline kernel available but it should be possible to mainline this device. Have a look at [http://blog.forkwhiletrue.me/pages/midas-mainline/ Midas on Mainline] for work on mainlining very similar devices.

Work to create a DTS for this device can be found here: [https://github.com/fourkbomb/linux/blob/8ce0752f2cc22b8f8fa980c21be802ea387f9a86/arch/arm/boot/dts/exynos4412-n7100.dts]

The n710x upstream DTS is here: [https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/arm/boot/dts/exynos4412-n710x.dts]

Replicant is interested in further mainlining this device and replacing the bootloader with u-boot and would like to collaborate with us [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/293#issuecomment-395889596].

This device's Qualcomm Gobi MDM9615 Modem seems to have some mainline kernel support: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/drivers/clk/qcom/gcc-mdm9615.c?h=v5.2.7
