== Summary ==
This is a thumbnail for a video showing how it is possible to obtain network, sound and keyboard input from a secondary device, in this case from the bottom of a DYI foldable phone, providing internet connectivity.
It also shows web surfing with (qutebrowser) running on the phone.
Part of the video is licensed as CC-BY-SA 4.0, while other parts are (hopefully) fair-use. In any case this is just a thumb + a link.
