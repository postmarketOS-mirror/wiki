'''[[Important]]'''! As noted later in the article, charging does currently not work with the mainline Linux kernel. If your battery's charge goes too low while using the phone, '''it may no longer be able to charge, even with the original firmware/recovery'''! Be careful!

== Installation ==
The mainline kernel can only be booted through U-Boot, not directly with the Samsung bootloader. U-Boot is installed as intermediate bootloader on the boot partition, so it does not replace the Samsung bootloader entirely. 

Boot into Download Mode using {{Button|Power}} + {{Button|Volume Down}} + {{Button|Home}} and follow the instructions at [[ST-Ericsson_NovaThor_U8500#U-Boot]] to install U-Boot.

Finally, just follow the [[Installation guide]].

== Notes ==

Since battery charging is not yet working with the mainline kernel, it is helpful to have an external Samsung battery charger at hand for charging the battery. If you plan to work intensively on the device, it is also nice to have two batteries so that you can charge one while working with the other. If you don't have an external battery charger you need to reflash the original firmware just to charge the battery which is not going to be possible if you run the battery out, so catch-22. Also worth noting is that even if you were to magically get the original firmware/recovery back on the device, you may end up in a situation where you cannot charge regardless because the phone turns off before it's able to start charging, and loops like this. In some cases it can reach enough charge during this to be able to charge properly eventually, but this may not always be the case. An external battery charger is definitely recommended.

== Mainline ==
'''Working:'''
* Display (no brightness control)
* GPU (Mali-400 MP using Lima)
* Touchscreen
* Broadcom WiFi
* Bluetooth (partial)
* Accelerometer
* Magnetometer/compass
* HALL sensor
* USB

'''Not working:'''
* Audio
* Camera
* ...

=== Bluetooth ===
Bluetooth does not have any Bluetooth device address (bdaddr or "MAC address") set after boot at the moment. To make Bluetooth work, you need to manually configure one:

 # apk add bluez-btmgmt
 # btmgmt public-addr <bdaddr>

where <code><bdaddr></code> is a MAC address like <code>53:33:6d:69:6e:69</code>.

The Bluetooth controller should then show up in <code>bluetoothctl</code>:

 # apk add bluez
 # rc-service bluetooth start
 $ bluetoothctl
