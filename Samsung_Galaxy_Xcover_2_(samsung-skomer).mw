== How to enter flash mode ==

Boot into Download Mode using {{Button|Power}} + {{Button|Volume Down}} + {{Button|Home}} and follow the instructions at [[ST-Ericsson_NovaThor_U8500#U-Boot]] to install U-Boot.

Finally, just follow the [[Installation guide]].

== Installation ==
The mainline kernel can only be booted through U-Boot, not directly with the Samsung bootloader. U-Boot is installed as intermediate bootloader on the boot partition, so it does not replace the Samsung bootloader entirely.
