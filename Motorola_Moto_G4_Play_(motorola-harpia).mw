== How to enter flash mode ==
Hold down {{Button|Power}} + {{Button|Volume Down}} while booting to enter Flash Mode.

== Installation ==
Install the [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd/releases/latest lk2nd bootloader], as it is required to handle some quirks
with msm8916 devices on mainline kernels. Flash the <code>lk2nd.img</code> image to the boot partition with <code>fastboot flash boot /path/to/lk2nd.img</code>. lk2nd
also provides a fastboot interface that allows for flashing kernels without overwriting lk2nd itself. To enter it, power on the device, then hold down Vol Down as soon
as you see the boot splash. You should be presented with a menu that looks like the following:

[[File:Motorola-harpia_lk2nd_example.jpeg|x500px]]

After that, proceed with [[Installation_guide#Installation_and_flashing|installation]] as usual, using lk2nd's fastboot interface to flash the kernel and rootfs.

== Usage ==
=== Audio ===
See [[Qualcomm_Snapdragon_410_(MSM8916)#Audio]].

=== Modem ===
Follow the directions on [[Qualcomm_Snapdragon_410_(MSM8916)#Modem|this wiki page]] to use the modem. If you have a device model other than what is listed here, please edit the list below
with the results of modem functionality testing.

* '''XT1602:''' Modem working, can send and receive text messages. Can initiate and answer phone calls. Mobile data does not work.
* '''XT1607:''' Modem working, SIM is recognized by qmicli but not ofonoctl says "No SIM". Maybe my device is network locked. I will research.
  harpia:~$ sudo qmicli -d /dev/modem --uim-get-card-status
  [/dev/modem] Successfully got card status
  Provisioning applications:
        Primary GW:   slot '1', application '1'
        Primary 1X:   session doesn't exist
        Secondary GW: session doesn't exist
        Secondary 1X: session doesn't exist
  Slot [1]:

        UPIN state: 'not-initialized'
                UPIN retries: '0'
                UPUK retries: '0'
        Application [1]:
                Application type:  'usim (2)'

                        PUK2 retries: '10'

Running --uim-change-provisioning-session seems happy, but still no SIM in ofonoctl
  harpia:~$ sudo qmicli -d /dev/modem --uim-change-provisioning-session="slot=1,activate=yes,session-type=primary-gw-provisioning,aid=$REDACTED"
  [/dev/modem] Successfully changed provisioning session
