== How to enter flash mode ==
Hold down {{Button|Power}} + {{Button|Volume Down}} while booting to enter Flash Mode.

== Installation ==
Install the [https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd/releases/latest lk2nd bootloader], as it is required to handle some quirks
with msm8916 devices on mainline kernels. Flash the <code>lk2nd.img</code> image to the boot partition with <code>fastboot flash boot /path/to/lk2nd.img</code>. lk2nd
also provides a fastboot interface that allows for flashing kernels without overwriting lk2nd itself. To enter it, power on the device, then hold down Vol Down as soon
as you see the boot splash. You should be presented with a menu that looks like the following:

After that, proceed with [[Installation_guide#Installation_and_flashing|installation]] as usual, using lk2nd's fastboot interface to flash the kernel and rootfs.

== Usage ==
=== Audio ===
See [[Qualcomm_Snapdragon_410_(MSM8916)#Audio]].

=== Modem ===
Follow the directions on [[Qualcomm_Snapdragon_410_(MSM8916)#Modem|this wiki page]] to use the modem. If you have a device model other than what is listed here, please edit the list below
