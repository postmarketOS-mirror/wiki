== Notes ==

This device seems to suffer from issues with the postmarketOS toolchain. See [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/848 here] for more information.

Current fork with the code used to get this far is available [https://github.com/magmastonealex/pmbootstrap here].

* Boot with LineageOS kernel (with postmarketOS configuration)
* Weston
* Touchscreen

'''With pmOS built kernel'''
* Boot
* Touchscreen (but NOT display)

== What does not work ==
* Everything else

==Current Work==

* osk-sdl porting (black screen is current issue)
* Debugging why postmarketOS kernel causes panics when framebuffer is accessed.
