=== What does not work ===

* Audio
* Both cameras

=== Installation ===

# Init pmbootstrap

<source lang="bash">$ ./pmbootstrap.py init</source>
# Start the build process and install flash to the device

<source lang="bash"># Replace /dev/sdX with the device for your sdcard
$ ./pmbootstrap.py install
$ ./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_system
$ ./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_kernel</source>

==== Wifi ====

The <code>linux-firmware</code> (included by default) package is required to provide the brcmfmac firmware necessary for initializing the wifi device.

Once the device has been successfully initialized, enable it:

<pre>$ sudo ip link set wlan0 up</pre>
Configure wpa_supplicant (only necessary on encrypted networks):

<pre>$ sudo su -
# wpa_passphrase $YOUR_SSID &gt; /etc/wpa_supplicant/wlan0.conf
&lt;enter passphrase here and press Enter&gt;
# exit</pre>
Connect to network using wpa_supplicant:

<pre>$ sudo wpa_supplicant -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wlan0.conf </pre>
If your network uses DHCP, start the DHCP client:

<pre>$ sudo udhcpc -i wlan0</pre>
==== Freedreno ====

Freedreno is only supported with X atm as weston segfaults<br />
Here are some games being played https://imgur.com/a/ji6jl#jhR61Ww

<source lang="bash"># Install mesa and X allong with the touchscreen driver
$ sudo apk add mesa mesa-dri-freedreno xorg-server xf86-input-libinput

# Start X
$ sudo X &</source>
==== Setting the date ====

Since the rtc driver is read only you need to use ntp to set the date

<source lang="bash"># Install openntpd
$ sudo apk add openntpd

# Write the current system time to the hardware clock
$ sudo ntp -s</source>
