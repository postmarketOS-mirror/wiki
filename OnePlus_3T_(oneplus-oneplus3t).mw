== Unlocking the Bootloader ==

'''WARNING: Doing this will wipe ALL data on your device. Please backup all your personal data before continuing!'''
# Enable <code>Developer options</code> by tapping the build number 7 times in <code>Settings</code> > <code>About</code>
# Go to <code>Developer options</code> and enable both <code>USB Debugging</code> and <code>OEM Unlocking</code>
# Open a terminal window and type <code>adb devices</code> to verify your device is visible.
# Type <code>adb reboot bootloader</code> to reboot your device into fastboot mode. 
# Type <code>fastboot devices</code> to verify once again that your device is visible.
# Type <code>fastboot oem unlock</code>. To navigate the on screen options use {{button|Volume Up/Down}} and select an option with the {{button|Power}} button.
# Congrats, your bootloader is now unlocked!


== How to enter flash mode ==
# After the bootloader is unlocked press the {{button|Power}} button and you should see the warning screen. Press {{button|Volume Up/Down}} to open the boot options. 
# Select <code>Fastboot</code> and press {{button|Power}}
You are now ready to flash.
