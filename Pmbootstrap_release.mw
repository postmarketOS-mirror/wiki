Checklist for creating a <code>pmbootstrap</code> release:

* set version in <code>pmb/config/__init__.py</code> to the new version
* tag a release in gitlab (look at the previous commits to write a good description of what changed)
* update the pypi release (see the script in {{issue|1679}})
* update the pmbootstrap aport in pmaports (change the pkgrel, update the checksum, build)
