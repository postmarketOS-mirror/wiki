* [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/tags/new tag a release in gitlab]
** fill out "release notes" (we can use markdown there), leave "message" empty
** look at the [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/commits/master previous commits] to write a good description of what changed
* update the pypi release (see the script in {{issue|1679}})
* update the pmbootstrap aport in pmaports (change the pkgrel, update the checksum, build)
