== How to enter flash mode ==
The Essential Phone uses Fastboot as the flashing protocol.

To enter Fastboot mode, hold {{Button|Volume Down}} while powering on the device. Let go of {{Button|Volume Down}} when "Fastboot mode" displays on the screen. 

== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->

    fastboot --set-active=a
    pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs --partition system_a
    pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel --partition boot_a

== Status ==
Currently a work in progress. Kernel compiles.

== Config settings needed to compile ==
Set:
   CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO=m
   CONFIG_DIAG_CHAR=n
   CONFIG_USB_CONFIGFS=y


Defaults:
   CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO=y
   CONFIG_DIAG_CHAR=y
   CONFIG_USB_CONFIGFS=m
