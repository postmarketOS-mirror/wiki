== How to enter flash mode ==
The Essential Phone uses Fastboot as the flashing protocol.

To enter Fastboot mode, hold {{Button|Volume Down}} while powering on the device. Let go of {{Button|Volume Down}} when "Fastboot mode" displays on the screen. 

== Installation ==
<!-- add more sections below as necessary, e.g. Wifi, photos, ... -->

== Status ==
Currently a work in progress. After patching, fails to compile kernel.
