== How to enter flash mode ==
Since there are no kernel sources that work with the device, you'll have to unpack your boot image and drop in initramfs of another pmOS compatible device that has same SoC, then repack, make sure offsets are intact. Fastboot does work to same extent as TWRP recovery installation. Entering fastboot requires you to power off the device and then attempting to power it on while holding volume up. That enters you to a selection menu where you navigate using volume up button, select fastboot and then volume down to confirm.

== Installation ==
No kernel sources available. Only gets to telnet on stock ROM kernel and initramfs of a similar device. If you are brave enough, you can try using a similar device like [[Wiko_Fever_(wiko-fever)|Wiko Fever]]
