== How to enter flash mode ==
There is probably no kind of flash mode or recovery mode on this device. The boot loader (uboot) checks for compiled script in path /boot/FirmwareInstall/autorun.1.wmt.

Some of these devices might also check for boot options over the built in ethernet port.

== Installation ==
Install PMOS to sd card. Start device with the sdcard in the internal card reader of the device. You should see a text in top left corner saying "BOOTING!!"

If for some reason no text comes up, try copy the file /boot/FirmwareInstall/autorun.1.wmt to path /wmt_scriptcmd on sdcard.

== General ==
This is a somewhat exotic version of the standard VIA / WonderMedia 8850 laptops. They should all be pretty compatible, except for
* Memory size: 128MB, 256 MB, 512 MB and 1024 MB versions seems to exist. Needs variable change in uboot script.
* Flash size: Unknown, but boots only from sd card for now. There is an unstable driver for the nand chips
* Screen: 800x480 and 1024 x 600. Should not need config change to boot.

So if you have a similar laptop there is a high possibility that this port works out of the box.
Other versions of this device is known as Eken, Mid7, Mid8, Mid9, Mid10....

== Wifi ==

Wifi is a usb dongle soldered directly to motherboard. It is triggered on and off by a magic GPIO command. This is still a work in progress.

See https://kernelhacks.blogspot.com/2012/06/arch-linux-on-wm8650-netbook.html:
Upon installing this package, to enable the WiFi chip, you have to input the command:
<code>gpio 1:6:d8110040:d8110080:d81100c0</code>
And to disable the WiFi chip:
<code>gpio 0:6:d8110040:d8110080:d81100c0</code>

Searching for 8850 uboot shows that some bootloader scripts sets a lot of GPIO pins on boot, for example:

<code>setenv wmt.gpi.bat [0:0:00040000:d8110040:d8110080:d8110000:d8110480:d81104C0][1:0:00000020:d8110040:d8110080:d8110000:d8110480:d81104C0][2:1:00010000:d8110040:d8110080:d8110000:d8110480:d81104C0]

setenv wmt.gpo.wifi 6:0:6:d8110040:d8110080:d81100C0

setenv wmt.io.bat 3:2:1000:f25:dc4:f32:ea0:e75:e47:e12:de2:db7:d80:d3d:cfe:cbc

setenv wmt.pwbn.param 100:100:100</code>

== TODO ==
* Find source for "gpio" binary -> toggle gpio pin for wifi
* Get to boot with postmarketos-stable instead of 4.3.0 mainline
