=== What works ===

* Compiling the kernel
* Flashing pmos + kernel
* Telnet into it, fill in passphrase for decrypting system and get into SSH

=== Current status === 

This currently only works when replacing the ramdisk in the LineageOS boot.img with pmos one using abootimg (so we use the prebuilt kernel of lineageOS).

=== Other information ===
* when red leds are flashing, offsets are wrong
* LineageOS boot.img is far larger because the recovery is inside it
