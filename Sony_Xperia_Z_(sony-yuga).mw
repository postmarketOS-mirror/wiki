=== What works ===

* Compiling the kernel
* Flashing pmos + kernel
* Telnet into it using the usb-shell procedure as described on [[Initramfs development]]

=== Current status === 

Telnet into initramfs (from [[Initramfs development]]) only works when replacing the ramdisk in the LineageOS boot.img with pmos one using abootimg.

=== Other information ===
* when red leds are flashing, offsets are wrong
* LineageOS boot.img is far larger because the recovery is inside it
