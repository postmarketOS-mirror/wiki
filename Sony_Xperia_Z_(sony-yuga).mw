=== Special keycombo's ===

* Boot to bootloader (fastboot): unplug device, hold volume up and plug usb into device
* Reset if stuck: hold volume up and power button till the phone shakes

=== Non-standard notes ===

The Xperia Z does not have a recovery partition, so flashing PostmarketOS erases any recovery you have installed.  Instructions across the internet for reinstalling a custom recovery are almost all incorrect.

To install a custom recovery on the Xperia Z:
* put the device in fastboot mode
* run <code>fastboot flash boot recovery.img</code> (replace <code>recovery.img</code> with the filename of your recovery of choice)

=== What works ===

* charging
* network through USB
* telnet in initramfs
* ssh
* adjusting the led, torch and the lcd backlight
* display
** Weston
** Xwayland
* touchscreen

=== What does not work ===

* Splash screens

=== What has not been tested ===

* Bluetooth
* 3G
* Sound
* Phone calls
* SD card
* Wifi

=== Issues ===

* Launching Weston is delayed by 135 seconds to let udev settle down
* Display works only when running <code>cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/modes > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/mode</code> after being logged in using SSH.

=== Other information ===

* When red leds are flashing, offsets are wrong
* LineageOS boot.img is far larger because the recovery is inside it
* It should be possible to run [[The Mainline Kernel]] on the device. At least there is a <code>dts</code> file already in the 4.14 kernel: <code>arch/arm/boot/dts/qcom-apq8064-sony-xperia-yuga.dts</code>
