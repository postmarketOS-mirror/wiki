== What works ==
* USB ethernet
* Flashing, via android-recovery-zip (twrp)
* Touchscreen (ft5x06_i2c)
* Screen: framebuffer (/dev/fb0), backlight & brigtness control (/sys/class/leds/wled:backlight/brightness)
* Notification leds (/sys/class/leds/red/brigtness, /sys/class/leds/green/brightness, /sys/class/leds/blue/brightness)
* Wifi: via wcnss-wlan and wlanarmani service (which does modprobe wlan on system boot after wcnss-wlan service has been initialized)
* Xwayland
* Battery: charging status (/sys/class/power_supply/battery/status), capacity reporting (/sys/class/power_supply/battery/capacity)
* Buttons: KEY_POWER, KEY_VOLUMEUP, and KEY_VOLUMEDOWN (triggerhappy can be used to handle them)

== What does not work ==
* Screen: framebuffer console (no kernel boot log printed on the display)
* Wifi: rfkill (no support for blocking wireless via rfkill block wifi or nmcli radio wifi off). The only way to block wireless is unloading wlan module (``rmmod wlan`` or ``/etc/init.d/wlanarmani stop``)
* Other hardware features are untested (3D, sound, bluetooth, modem, gps, accelerometer)
* Xorg based UI: postmarketos-ui-xfce4 displays nothing on the screen.

== How to enter flash mode ==
* Entering fastboot: hold VolumeKeyDown + Power buttons until fastboot mode displayed on the screen.
* Entering recovery: hold VolumeKeyUp + Power buttons. The default is Mi Recovery. TWRP is needed for installation, which can be obtained [https://twrp.me/xiaomi/xiaomiredmi1s.html here]

== Installation ==
* Put the device into TWRP recovery, either by booting twrp image via fastboot directly or by pressing VolumeKeyUp + Power button after flashing TWRP recovery image.
* Connect the device to the computer via usb cable
* Bootstrap PostmarketOS

:<code>$ pmbootstrap init #select xiaomi-armani</code>

:* Optional: build the device specific packages. Actually, there is no need to build the device specific packages since they are available on PostmarketOS repository.

::<code>$ pmbootstrap build -i device-xiaomi-armani</code>

::<code>$ pmbootstrap build -i firmware-xiaomi-armani</code>

::<code>$ pmbootstrap build linux-xiaomi-armani</code>

:<code>$ pmbootstrap install --no-fde --android-recovery-zip</code>

:<code>$ pmbootstrap export # generate symlinks inside /tmp/postmarketOS-export directory</code>

* Put the twrp recovery into sideload mode

:<code>$ adb shell "twrp sideload"</code>

* Start sideloading the recovery file

:<code>$ adb sideload /tmp/postmarketOS-export/pmos-xiaomi-armani.zip</code>

* Reboot the device

:<code>$ adb reboot</code>

== Additional info ==
It's necessary to unplug the usb cable after issuing ``poweroff`` command to properly shut down PostmarketOS.

Don't leave screen on for a long time, otherwise there will be LED burn-in. If the display screen is not used, turn the screen off.

:<code>$ echo 0 | sudo tee "/sys/class/leds/wled:backlight/brightness"</code>

The screen can be turned on with maximum value up to 4095

:<code>$ echo 3072 | sudo tee "/sys/class/leds/wled:backlight/brightness"</code>

Battery state can be monitored. Refer to [[Battery capacity monitoring]] for more information.
