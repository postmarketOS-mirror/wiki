== Serial console ==
The PinePhone has a serial port in the headphone connector, it's activated by the 6th contact on the dipswitch. If the switch is on then the headphone connector is in audio mode, if it's off then it's in UART mode.

The uart is 115200n8

The pinout for the serial connector on the tablet side is:

* Tip: RX
* Ring: TX
* Sleeve: GND

The serial connection is 3.3V

You can also buy the debug cable from [https://store.pine64.org PINE64 Store]

=== Cameras ===

The camera's both share the csi-0 bus. Currently only the rear camera (OV5640) has mainline linux support.

It's also not clear how the camera switching would work on the software side, maybe Linux just deals with it if the device tree nodes for the second camera get added.

The camera hardware pipeline is controlled with <code>/dev/media0</code> and <code>media-ctl</code>, the result is on <code>/dev/video0</code>

<source lang="shell-session">
pine-dontbeevil:~# media-ctl --set-v4l2 '"ov5640 2-003c":0[fmt:UYVY8_2X8/1280x720]'
pine-dontbeevil:~# ffmpeg -s 1280x720 -f video4linux2 -i /dev/video0 -vframes 1 selfie.jpg
</source>

=== Camera Flash ===

The camera flash consist out of a SG Micro SGM3140 "500mA Buck/Boost Charge Pump LED Driver" and a EHP-C04 LED.

The driver supports Flash and Torch mode, the first being brighter but only for about 300ms, when it switches to Torch mode. Torch mode is lower brightness but can be turned on continuously.

<source lang="shell-session">
# Turn on Flash, wait 0.3s, turn off
echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/sgm3140-flash/flash_strobe
sleep 0.3
echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/sgm3140-flash/flash_strobe
</source>

<source lang="shell-session">
# Turn on Torch
echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/sgm3140-flash/brightness
# Turn off Torch
echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/sgm3140-flash/flash_strobe
</source>


=== WiFi ===

WiFi generally works but the driver is quite sporadic when it wants to work. Rebooting/rmmod and modprobe'ing the driver/rfkill block - unblock helps.

<source lang="dmesg">

=== Bluetooth ===

There is a patch series on lkml. A v2 for this series is in progress.

=== Modem ===

Receiving text messages works. Calls should work too but weren't tested yet.

=== Sensors ===

All sensors work and are accessible as Industrial I/O (iio) devices in linux. To query the data you can cat the files in `/sys/bus/iio/` to make the kernel module query the sensors

<source lang="shell-session">
dontbeevil:~# cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/name
mpu6050
dontbeevil:~# cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/in_accel_z_raw
-17594
dontbeevil:~# echo "Verified gravity still exists"
</source>

=== RGB Led ===

The RGB led works with the led driver, but due to hardware bugs there can be only one led active at the same time and the blue led doesn't work because some pins are reversed.
<source lang="shell-session">
# Activate LED
echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/$COLOR/brightness
# Deactivate LED
echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/$COLOR/brightness
</source>

=== Audio ===

==== Speakers ====

Sound output should work after unmuting <code>AIF1 Slot 0 digital</code>

==== Mic ====

Doesn't work yet.

=== USB ===
Doesn't work for MartijnBraam, reported to work for other people.
