== Audio ==
TODO - audio hasn't been worked on as of yet, although the adsp audio processor subsystem boots.

== Modem ==
The modem is controlled by the Q6V5 MSS Peripheral Image Loader, it is required to boot the WiFi adapter.
ofonoctl currently shows no output when the modem is booted, however further testing has not been undertaken.

== WiFi ==
Wifi is functional! Firmware for the modem and ath10k module must be loaded in order to have functional wifi.

3 packages are required for functional wifi:

rmtfs, pd-mapper and tqftpserv can all be installed with apk add ({{MR|1080|pmaports}}).

[https://github.com/jhugo/linux/tree/5.5rc2_wifi This readme] can then be followed to fixup the firmware.

For some devices [https://gitlab.com/sdm845-mainline/sdm845-linux-next/-/commit/698b631a6aaf7a2c2f91c9514c552a734e1cdc63 this commit] is also needed
as some wlan firmware blobs don't play ball.

TODO: Build sdm845 firmware packages for OnePlus enchilada / fajita.

== Display ==

The Adreno 630 is relatively easy to work with, after adding a driver for your panel, obtain [https://gitlab.com/sdm845-mainline/sdm845-linux-next/-/commit/41ac945f035a7facab53b43d7c3506870f1fb2b4 the firmware] from
your device and either compile into the kernel (in addition to enabling CONFIG_DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION for early dmesg)) or add to the right subdirectory under /lib/firmware.
