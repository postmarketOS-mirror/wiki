== Board ==
Wiko U Feel is based on Tinno p6601 board (like BLU R1 HD, Lanix Ilium L910, QMobile Noir A6, Evertek EverSolo, Smart Art P6601).

== Audio ==
Sound card is detected in alsamixer, but dosen't work

== How to enter flash mode ==
Fastboot is broken. It gives Unknown Chunk type, but it is possible to install pmOS with TWRP. Refer to [[Android_Recovery_Zip_Installation]] for installing. 

Flashing with proprietary program SP Flash Tool also work fine. Tested with flashed emmc boot partition and system partition stored on external sdcard.
