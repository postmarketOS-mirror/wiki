== How to enter flash mode ==
Power + Volume Down buttons or use adb reboot-bootloader or Power + Volume Up buttons

== Installation ==
I installed the rootfs on a /system partition. Flashing the kernel to the boot partition tested, rootfs flashing.
Only tested recovery zip, unknown if fastboot works because my bootloader doesn't allow flashing, but allows booting and is otherwise unlocked.

Initial merge request:
* {{MR|286|pmaports}} Initial merge request
* {{ISSUE|216|pmaports}}I wasn't able to add a hook that is in device/device-motorola-montana/initfs-hook.sh into rootfs.
