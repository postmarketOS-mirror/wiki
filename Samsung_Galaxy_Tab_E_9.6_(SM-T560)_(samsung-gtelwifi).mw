=== How atipls made wifi work ===

How atipls made wifi work (with a bit of confusing detours). [[Medion_Lifetab_S9714_(medion-kai)#How_bonsaiblue_made_wifi_work|Inspired by the (sort of) helpful How_bonsaiblue_made_wifi_work]].

* Since the kernel provided by Samsung has built-in support for the BCM4343, enabling it was enough to get wlan0 to show up.
** I actually have tried loading it as a kernel module, which ended up with horrible messages like <code>no wifi platform data, skip</code> and <code>DHD wifi platform data is required for Android build</code>
* Grab nvram_mfg.txt and bcmdhd_mfg.bin from /etc/wifi from either a stock install or an unofficial lineageos port.
** I have also tried <code>firmware-aosp-broadcom-wlan</code>, but the firmware seems to be newer than wanted thus either not loading or straight up soft bricking the OS.
* Bring the interface up: <code>$ ip link set wlan0 up</code>
* Use XFCE4's menu or <code>nmtui</code> to connect to a wifi network.
