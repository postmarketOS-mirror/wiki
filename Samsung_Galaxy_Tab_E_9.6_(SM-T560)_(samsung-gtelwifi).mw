pmbootstrap install --android-recovery-zip
pmbootstrap flasher --method=adb sideload

== What works ==
* Flashing rootfs and kernel via TWRP
* Screen (boot logo, is in wrong orientation)

== What doesn't work ==
* Everything else

== Additional notes ==
It seems to run exceptionally slowly, and while USB Networking works, it's very inconsistent often locking up the entire system.
