== How to enter flash mode ==
Power+Vol+Up - recovery
Power+Vol+Down - odin/download

== Installation ==
Run pmbootstrap install (without installing to the SD card, since we need it to store the boot.img for flashing), run pmbootstrap export, flash the boot.img manually through TWRP, then reinstall to SD card.

Android ZIP install errors out, heimdall doesn't work due to a different flashing protocol.

Note: pmOS does not fit on the system partition. You have to use an SD card.

Boot gets stuck on Galaxy Y logo. No USB output. (TODO: Does maximum-attention work?)
