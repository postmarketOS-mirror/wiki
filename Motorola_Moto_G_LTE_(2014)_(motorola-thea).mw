== How to enter flash mode ==
Hold PWR+VOL- for a few seconds, then let go of both of them.

== Disclaimer ==
This device is *literally* motorola-titan but with an 4G/LTE modem (and some under-the-hood regulator changes, but DT manages that), so they use a commonized kernel package.

== Installation ==
Nothing special, just your typical `pmbootstrap install` && `pmbootstrap flasher` combo.
