Unless a device has been [[The Mainline Kernel|mainlined]], we need to package the vendor kernel (also called "downstream kernel"). This is the reference for the {{alpine|APKBUILD}} files of vendor kernels.

== Generate a template ==
Usually you would generate both a new [[device specific package]] and a new vendor kernel package by running <code>pmbootstrap init</code> and typing in a new device name. In case you should only have a device package, but not a kernel package, you can regenerate the latter with <code>pmbootstrap aportgen linux-changeme-changeme</code> (you guessed it, <i>changeme</i> needs to be adjusted).

The template gets improved every now and then to make porting easier, so don't be surprised when you are looking at older ports and their APKBUILDs look a bit more complicated than what gets generated from the latest <code>pmbootstrap</code> version. Essentially they are doing the same thing.
