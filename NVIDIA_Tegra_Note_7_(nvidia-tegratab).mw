== How to enter flash mode ==
Hold {{Button|Power}} + {{Button|Vol Up}}, enter to <code>fastboot protocol</code>

== Memo ==
Using GCC6, 

Mostly flashing method doesn't work, but <code>pmbootstrap install --sdcard</code> is OK,

boot to<code>pmbootstrap flasher boot</code>

I'm not recommended <code>flasher flash_kernel</code>, because you can't charging battery!
