== How to enter flash mode ==
Hold power button + vol down button, enter<code>→fastboot protocol</code>

== Memo ==
Using GCC6,

Direct flashing doesn't work, <code>pmbootstrap install --sdcard</code>method is OK,

boot to<code>pmbootstrap flasher boot</code>

I'm not recommended <code>flasher flash_kernel</code>, because you can't charging battery!
