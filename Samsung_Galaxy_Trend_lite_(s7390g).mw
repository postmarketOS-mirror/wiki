== Device name ==
The device might be identified as a Samsung Galaxy Trend Lite, Samsung Galaxy Fresh, GT-S7390G or GT-S7390. It is also available as Samsung Galaxy Fresh Duos S7392 with dual-SIM card slots ([https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_fresh_s7390-5841.php source])

== What works ==
* Flash kernel
* USB Network
* Screen
* Touch (<code>/dev/input/event2</code>)

== What does not work ==

* Audio

== What has not been tested ==
* Compass, accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS, light sensor
* Bluetooth, NFC
* Wifi/GSM
* Camera
* Flash Rootfs
* Vibration motor

== How to enter flash mode ==
* Press volume down and the home key, then press the power button.
* Maintain volume down and home pressed until a warning screen comes up
* press volume up to confirm, and plug the phone in if it wasn't already.

Note: the bootloader seems to be factory-unlocked.


== How to enter Recovery ==
* Press volume up and the home key, then press the power button.
* Maintain volume up and home pressed until the recovery comes up

It is very easy to install a recovery: just flash a boot image to the RECOVERY partition with heimdall. You can get one from [https://forum.xda-developers.com/samsung-s7390/development/recovery-twrp-2-8-6-0-galaxy-trend-lite-t3111041 here], for example. These come with ADB and other means (zip) to flash the firmware.

The original boot partition may be be installed there as well (when PMOS sits on the SD card), to [[Dual boot]] the phone (has not been tested yet).

== Misc ==
The soc is a member of the hawaii platform, so it's likely that the kernel or some other components can be reused on other devices from the same platform.

== Specs ==
