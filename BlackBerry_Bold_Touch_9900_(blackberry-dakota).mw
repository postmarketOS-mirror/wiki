== Random research ==
* There are OSes you can download, which includes a RAM loader for loading the OS; a later version of the RAM loader protocol (for BlackBerry 10, not classic, but seems similar) is https://github.com/xsacha/Sachesi/blob/master/src/boot.cpp
* there's at least one bootrom-level exploit for Snapdragon S4 (https://www.wpinternals.net/), so maybe older Snapdragons are also vulnerable
