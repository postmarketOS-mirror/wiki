== How to enter flash mode ==
# Turn off the device
# Press Power+Volume Down to enter fastboot

== Installation ==
{{note|<b>CAUTION</b>: Flashing any image with antirollback index lower than 4 (Android 8 or lower, for example) could potentially <b>brick</b> your device due to Anti-rollback protection. See [https://forum.xda-developers.com/redmi-note-5-pro/how-to/faq-questions-answered-t3816185 a related XDA Developers post] for more information.}}

Here's how to boot pmOS via fastboot:

# Install to a SD card with <code>pmbootstrap install --sdcard=/dev/sdX</code>
# Insert the SD card into the device
# Connect the device to your PC
# Enter the fastboot mode
# In order to boot an image with fastboot, an 8-Kb image of zeros should be flashed to the <code>antirbpass</code> partition every time we want to use <code>pmbootstrap flasher boot</code> or <code>fastboot boot</code>. Create an image if you haven't done that already: <syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">$ dd if=/dev/zero of=dummy.img bs=8K count=1</syntaxhighlight>
# Flash the freshly created <code>dummy.img</code> to the <code>antirbpass</code> partition: <syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">$ fastboot flash antirbpass dummy.img</syntaxhighlight>
# Finally, boot pmOS: <syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">$ pmbootstrap flasher boot</syntaxhighlight>
