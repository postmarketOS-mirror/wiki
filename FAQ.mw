== Why is postmarketOS based on Alpine Linux? ==

The biggest upside is, that Alpine is small. The base installation is about '''5 MB'''! Only because of that, our development/installation tool <code>pmbootstrap</code> is able to abstract everything in chroots and therefore keep the development environment the same, no matter which Linux distribution your host runs on.

And if you messed up (or we have a bug), you can simply run <code>pmbootstrap zap</code> and the chroot will be set up again in seconds. Imagine how long it would take to do the same with Debian (which is a fine distributions for plenty of other use cases).

Another angle on the tininess of Alpine - many older devices don't have much space to spare, so hilariously tiny system images can be quite useful or even required.


== Will Android apps be supported? ==
Currently, our best bet seems to be getting [[Anbox]] running on postmarketOS. It's highly recommended to use native Linux applications though, as there are some downsides to Android apps:
* Freedom issues (most are proprietary, or only work together with a proprietary network, some even track you), see [https://f-droid.org/ F-Droid] for FLOSS programs, that respect your freedom.
* Heavy resource usage: With all resources, we will most likely need to run a Android environment next to your regular Linux. So it will use up more RAM and CPU compared to native Linux applications.

So at least try to find a native-Linux alternative for your favorite application or ask yourself if you really need it. For app developers, consider using [https://dot.kde.org/2017/01/02/kde-releases-beta-kirigami-ui-20 Kirigami UI] or similar to develop apps for both mainstream mobile OSes (Android/iOS) as well as natively for Linux distributions.
