It can be installed by getting the <code>fractal</code> package from the alpine repos.


== Troubleshooting ==
=== Passwords are not saved ===
On some postmarketos installation, no keyring is created by default. This can be solved by downloading the <code>seahorse</code> package from alpine repos, pressing File > New > Password Keyring, and naming it login. You may have to use seahorse to unlock the keychain on each reboot, if your UI does not support unlocking keychains.
