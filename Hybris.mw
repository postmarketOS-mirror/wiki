[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybris_(software) Libhybris] is an Android compatibility layer, allowing libraries compiled with bionic libc to be loaded by applications built with different libc (originally glibc, musl in postmarketOS case). It allows to run proprietary Android userspace drivers on top of a downstream kernel by running parts of Android in a container. The upsides and downsides of this approach are discussed in {{issue|703|pmaports}}.

There were some efforts with limited success to make it work in postmarketOS. But due to lack of maintenance, it was decided to drop it in August of 2020.

If you are interested in working on libhybris, consider joining the excellent [https://ubports.com/ ubports] project. If it has to be postmarketOS and libhybris, please create your own aports repository and put the libhybris related packages there. Feel free to edit this wiki page and link to your repository.
