* rogier.oudshoorn (only kernel configuration; rest is taken from the [[Samsung_Galaxy_S4_Mini_LTE | LTE version of this device ]])

== Maintainer(s) ==

== Current main issues ==
* Device doesn't automatically give itself mac address, ip, etc - you need to [[USB_Network | configure the network manually ]]
* Device reboots immediately after flasher
* Charging is wierd; device boots when powered on but it's difficult getting it into fast if it has't connected to the charger for a while
* Screen has worked exactly once, on the initial flash (hence no image here)

== How to enter flash mode ==
* Hold home + volume down when booting the device

== Installation ==
