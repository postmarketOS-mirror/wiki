== How to enter flash mode ==
Hold <code>Power</code> + <code>Home</code> + <code>Vol Down</code> buttons to enter flash mode. Hold <code>Power</code> + <code>Home</code> + <code>Vol Up</code> buttons to enter recovery mode.

== Installation ==
Currently <code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs</code> fails at 17%, but <code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</code> works, so there are two ways:
* install on sdcard (untested)
* install via android recovery zip

== Wifi ==
To make wifi work, we need some binary blobs (download and wcnd, both located at /system/bin/ in stock rom), so we can:
* use libhybris
* see how Samsung Z1 handles it in Tizen (uses some Spreadtrum chip)
* recompile them from leaked sources
