The '''HTC Touch Pro2''' has different codenames for different carriers (Barium for AT&T). Rhodium seems to be the original codename for the carrier-neutral version.

Android seems to be working on the device, so there is at least a downstream kernel working: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa1Eu_hzX8Q
