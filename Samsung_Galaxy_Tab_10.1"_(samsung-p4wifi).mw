== Introduction ==

postmarketOS for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 runs on a Linux 4.14 kernel using both mainline and forward ported drivers. Some peripherals are using mainline device driver where applicable. Some peripherals which are not working on or don't have mainline drivers are using drivers forward ported from the stock 3.1.10 kernel.

== What works ==
* Flashing with heimdall
* USB SSH access
* Touch
* DRM fbdev / 2D acceleration (Grate driver)
* Wifi
* Battery

== What does not work ==
* 3D acceleration
* Audio
* Bluetooth
* Camera
* GPS
* Accelerometers

== How to enter flash mode ==
Press and hold Power + Volume Down buttons

== Installation ==

# Init pmbootstrap<source lang="shell">$ ./pmbootstrap.py init</source> Choose 'samsung-p4wifi' as target device.
# Start the build process<source lang="shell">$ ./pmbootstrap.py build linux-samsung-p4wifi
$ ./pmbootstrap.py build device-samsung-p4wifi
$ ./pmbootstrap.py install --no-fde</source>
# Enter flash (download) mode
# Flash the kernel and system images<source lang="shell">$./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_kernel
$./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_system</source>

== Wifi ==
# Load brcmfmac driver<source lang="shell">$ insmod /lib/modules/brcmutil.ko
$ insmod /lib/modules/brcmfmac.ko alternative_fw_path=postmarketos</source>
# Start wpa_supplicant<source lang="shell">$ wpa_supplicant -B -D nl80211 -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</source>
# Configure the IP address<source lang="shell">$ udhcpc -i wlan0</source>

== Other Information ==
==== Hardware Information & Driver Status ====

The Linux 4.14 mainlining effort contains drivers forward ported from the stock Samsung Linux 3.1.10 kernel which shipped with the device. Some peripheral devices have been transitioned over to the mainline driver.

Other drivers are not in the mainline kernel or the device is not compatible with the mainline driver
