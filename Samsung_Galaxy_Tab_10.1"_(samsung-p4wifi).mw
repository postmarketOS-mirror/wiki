== Introduction ==

postmarketOS for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 runs on mainline Linux kernel fork. The kernel uses both mainline and forward ported drivers. Some peripherals are using mainline device driver where applicable. Some peripherals which are not working on or don't have mainline drivers are using drivers forward ported from the stock 3.1.10 kernel.

== How to enter flash mode ==
Press and hold Power + Volume Down buttons

== Installation ==

# Init pmbootstrap<source lang="shell">$ ./pmbootstrap.py init</source> Choose 'samsung-p4wifi' as target device.
# Start the build process<source lang="shell">$ ./pmbootstrap.py build linux-samsung-p4wifi
$ ./pmbootstrap.py build device-samsung-p4wifi
$ ./pmbootstrap.py install --no-fde</source>
# Enter flash (download) mode
# Flash the kernel and system images<source lang="shell">$./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_kernel
$./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_rootfs</source>

== Battery ==
The battery in this device is the <code>max17042</code>. A tear down of the (nearly) identical Galaxy Tab 8.9 reveals that the charger is <code>max8903</code>.

Differences between mainline and downstream drivers:  

The downstream kernel provides an early implementation of a driver for the <code>max17042</code> battery. The implementation of the battery and charger driver are split across <code>p4_battery.c</code> and <code>max17042_battery.c</code>. The downstream charger driver implements additional logic to handle charge full and low battery events which may affect the health of the battery. The implementation details are not clear but the overall functionality appears to dynamically tune the full charge value. The mainline driver does not have this sort of functionality. The downstream driver reports the current in milliamp whereas the mainline driver is in microamp.

The <code>max8903</code> datasheet shows that there are separate GPIOs for USB and DC power connectors. This device has one connect GPIO for both USB and DC mode. The type of connector is determined by reading the <code>usb-sel</code> GPIOs. It's unclear which piece of hardware the usb-sel is coming from (max8903 / tegra soc / 30-pin connector ???).

== Graphics ==
The reverse engineer grate-driver provides 2D acceleration on X11. 3D acceleration is not implemented. This means that Xfce4 and Mate desktop will work. Hildon requires an OpenGL backend. Wayland UIs will only work with the framebuffer driver.

grate-drver packaging can be found at: [https://gitlab.com/ryang2678/pmaports/tree/feature/grate-driver https://gitlab.com/ryang2678/pmaports/tree/feature/grate-driver]

=== Video Decoding ===

Video Decoder Engine (VDE) was added to mainline kernel v4.16. The grate-driver includes hardware h264 decoding with libvdpau-tegra.

== Audio ==

Headphone and speaker output are working on the mainline wm8994 driver. Microphone inputs are not working.

The ALSA UCM config files were generated using the <code>xml2ucm</code> tool. The <code>mixer_paths.xml</code> and <code>p4wifi.config.xml</code> can be found in this [https://gist.github.com/Decatf/c37dda86a96f953f8b77eb9502d6681b github gist].
<source lang="shell">$ stack exec -- xml2ucm -m mixer_paths.xml -c p4wifi-config.xml -o examples</source>

== Wifi ==
The wifi chip in this device is the Broadcom BCM4330 B1 revision. There is a B2 revision which is much more common. The only distinguishing factor is the firmware. Only the B1 firmware will work on this device. The most common BCM4330 firmware found from various sources (such as <code>linux-firmware</code>) is for the B2 revision.

== Cellular Modem ==
The xmm6260 modem was used in quite a few Samsung Android devices from the same era as this tablet. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 3G (p4) and Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 from T-Mobile (p4tmo) are otherwise identical to the WiFi only version of the tablet (p4wifi). The cellular modem is connected via an internal USB interface called USB HSIC. The mainline Tegra USB driver does not implement this functionality. Much of the work in enabling the cellular stack would involve adding USB HSIC support to the mainline USB driver.


== Other Information ==
==== Hardware Information & Mainline Driver Status ====

The Linux mainlining effort contains drivers forward ported from the stock Samsung Linux 3.1.10 kernel which shipped with the device. Some peripheral devices have been transitioned over to the mainline driver. Other drivers are not in the mainline kernel or the device is not compatible with the mainline driver.

Notes:

: 1: kxt9f driver exists in mainline. The driver needs support device tree bindings.

: 2: ak8975 driver exists in mainline. The device id for ak8975c needs to be added to the driver. I (decatf) can't test it because the compass seems to report nonsense data. The compass on my tablet might be broken.

: 3: sii9234 driver exists in mainline. Requires someone with an MHL cable to implement / test it.
