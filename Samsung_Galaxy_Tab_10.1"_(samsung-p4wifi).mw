== Introduction ==

postmarketOS for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 runs on mainline Linux kernel fork. The kernel uses both mainline and forward ported drivers. Some peripherals are using mainline device driver where applicable. Some peripherals which are not working on or don't have mainline drivers are using drivers forward ported from the stock 3.1.10 kernel.

== What works ==
* Flashing with heimdall
* USB SSH access
* Touch
* DRM fbdev / 2D acceleration (Grate driver)
* Wifi
* Battery
* Audio (headphone & speaker only)
* Bluetooth

== What does not work ==
* 3D acceleration
* Camera
* GPS
* Accelerometers

== How to enter flash mode ==
Press and hold Power + Volume Down buttons

== Installation ==

# Init pmbootstrap<source lang="shell">$ ./pmbootstrap.py init</source> Choose 'samsung-p4wifi' as target device.
# Start the build process<source lang="shell">$ ./pmbootstrap.py build linux-samsung-p4wifi
$ ./pmbootstrap.py build device-samsung-p4wifi
$ ./pmbootstrap.py install --no-fde</source>
# Enter flash (download) mode
# Flash the kernel and system images<source lang="shell">$./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_kernel
$./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_rootfs</source>

== Graphics ==
The reverse engineer grate-driver provides 2D acceleration on X11. 3D acceleration is not working. This means that Xfce4 and Mate desktop will work. Hildon requires an OpenGL backend. Wayland UIs will only work with the framebuffer driver.

grate-drver packaging can be found at [http://github.com/Decatf/pmbootstrap/tree/mesa-grate github.com/Decatf/pmbootstrap/tree/mesa-grate]

== Audio ==

Headphone and speaker output are working on the mainline wm8994 driver. Microphone inputs are not working.

The ALSA UCM config files were generated using the <code>xml2ucm</code> tool. The <code>mixer_paths.xml</code> and <code>p4wifi.config.xml</code> can be found in this [https://gist.github.com/Decatf/c37dda86a96f953f8b77eb9502d6681b github gist].
<source lang="shell">$ stack exec -- xml2ucm -m mixer_paths.xml -c p4wifi-config.xml -o examples</source>

== Wifi ==
# Edit <code>/etc/conf.d/wpa_supplicant</code> and change the wpa_supplicant driver from  <code>wext,nl80221</code> to <code>nl80211 </code>
# Set up a WIFI access point <source lang="shell">$ wpa_passphrase YOUR_SSID YOUR_PASSPHRASE | sudo tee /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</source>
# Restart wpa_supplicant service <source lang="shell">$ service wpa_supplicant restart</source>
# Request an IP address <source lang="shell">$ udhcpc -i wlan0</source>

== Cellular Modem ==
The xmm6260 modem was used in quite a few Samsung Android devices from the same era as this tablet. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 3G (p4) and Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 from T-Mobile (p4tmo) are otherwise identical to the WiFi only version of the tablet (p4wifi). The cellular modem is connected via an internal USB interface called USB HSIC. The mainline Tegra USB driver does not implement this functionality. Much of the work in enabling the cellular stack would involve adding USB HSIC support to the mainline USB driver.


== Other Information ==
==== Hardware Information & Mainline Driver Status ====

The Linux mainlining effort contains drivers forward ported from the stock Samsung Linux 3.1.10 kernel which shipped with the device. Some peripheral devices have been transitioned over to the mainline driver. Other drivers are not in the mainline kernel or the device is not compatible with the mainline driver.
