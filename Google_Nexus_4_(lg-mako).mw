* ollieparanoid
* PabloCastellano and robb4 on IRC: Workaround for red screen bug [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/54 #54]

=== Entering &quot;Fastboot mode&quot; ===

Hold <code>Volume Down</code> + <code>Power</code>, let go of <code>Power</code> once the device display does something (e.g. turns from battery icon to black screen).

=== What works ===

* Touchscreen
* Weston (has the red screen bug, but we have a workaround for that now üëç )

=== What does not work ===

* XWayland
* The rest (Wifi, bluetooth, making calls, ...)
* fbsplash only displays splash images very shortly, then goes to black screen

=== Wifi ===

Looks like, we need to package the [https://github.com/LineageOS/android_device_lge_mako/blob/12ac6e9aeb32d5ac9fc832f2214ede2c7690d0a6/proprietary-blobs.txt#L152-L157 wcnss.* files] for wifi. A version from 2015 can be found [https://github.com/TheMuppets/proprietary_vendor_lge/tree/cm-14.1/mako/proprietary/vendor/firmware here]. It's a Qualcomm chip.

=== Alternative kernels ===

These are not packaged yet in postmarketOS, feel free to package them.
