== What works ==
The device does boot fine. SSH via USB is available. The display and touchscreen work.

== What does not work ==
Other features not mentioned are untested.

== How to enter flash mode ==
With the device powered off, hold the "volume up" button while connecting the USB cable. The LED should turn blue.

== Installation ==
Due to the insufficent capacity of the internal memory, the ''rootfs'' image must be installed on an microSD card.
It is suggested to install using the [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/456 netcat] method, using
as target device the entire microSD card (''/dev/mmcblk0'').
