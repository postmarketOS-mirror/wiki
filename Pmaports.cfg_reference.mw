|-
| <code>version</code>
| pmbootstrap compares this with <code>pmb.config.pmaports_min_version</code> and complains if this version isn't at least as high as the version that pmbootstrap requires
| <code>5</code>
|-
| <code>pmbootstrap_min_version</code>
| pmbootstrap compares this with <code>pmb.config.version</code> and complains if this branch of pmaports needs a newer pmbootstrap version
| <code>1.17.0</code>
|-
| <code>channel</code>
| One of the release channels defined in [[channels.cfg reference|channels.cfg]]. While channels.cfg already defines the pmaports branch related to a given channel, it is needed to save the channel in pmaports.cfg of each branch as well, so we know to which channel a forked branch belongs.
