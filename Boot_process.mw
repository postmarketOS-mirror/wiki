Have you already flashed your device with pmOS? Now it's time to run it.

Power on your device and connect it to your USB port. pmOS uses the USB interface as a network interface and runs a DHCP server on it and <code>dmesg</code> will show something like

<pre>[ 6284.442088] usb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 36 using xhci_hcd
[ 6284.627106] usb 1-1: New USB device found, idVendor=18d1, idProduct=d001
[ 6284.627123] usb 1-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3

[ 6284.627151] usb 1-1: SerialNumber: 0123456789ABCDEF

[ 6285.287058] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): enp0s20f0u1: link is not ready</pre>
And you'll have a new interface with IP in the range 172.16.42.0/24

<pre>$ ifconfig enp0s20f0u1
enp0s20f0u1 Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr b2:c4:1e:03:64:b9  
          inet addr:172.16.42.107  Bcast:172.16.42.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::dbd2:4531:89f2:d2/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:12 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:47 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
          RX bytes:1226 (1.2 KB)  TX bytes:8375 (8.3 KB)</pre>
It the interface doesn't automatically get an IP address on your system (for example on systems without NetworkManager) you need to start a dhcp client to get one.

<source lang="bash"># Replace the interface name with the one on your machine
$ dhclient -v enp0s20f0u1</source>
If this fails, you may need to first assign an ethernet address to it:

<pre># ip l set enp0s20f0u1 address 12:12:12:12:12:12</pre>
Then you can try the above dhclient command.

At this point, your device will show a logo and will be waiting for you to connect using telnet and enter the password to decrypt the filesystem (Make sure the last segment of the IP address is a &quot;1&quot; and not what is shown in the output of <code>ifconfig</code>!).

<pre>telnet 172.16.42.1
Trying 172.16.42.1...
Connected to 172.16.42.1.
Escape character is '^]'.

Enter passphrase for /dev/mapper/mmcblk0p25p2: 
Connection closed by foreign host.</pre>
After entering the password, you'll get disconnected and the graphic interface will show up in your device.

Congratulations, you are now running postmarketOS!

From now on you can also login to your device using <code>ssh</code> and the password you set during the install phase

<pre>$ ssh user@172.16.42.1
user@172.16.42.1's password:
