== Entering Fastboot mode ==

Power off the device. Hold <code>Back</code> as you plug the USB cable into the device.

== What works ==

* Compiling kernel
* Installing to system partition of image file

== What does not work ==

* ???

Testing device had permanent locked bootloader, so flashing could not be tested. However, everything built successfully. Further testing on a device with an unlocked bootloader will be needed to know what works and how to continue

== Additional info ==

* Page size may need to be adjusted in the future, as it is non-standard and presents a non-fatal error.
