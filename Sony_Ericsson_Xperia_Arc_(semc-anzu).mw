Power off the device. Hold <code>Back</code> as you plug the USB cable into the device.

Just for the records of you gentlemen, I wanted to let you know that all the 2011 xperia (manufactured before a not-so-clear 2012 week), are capable of *unofficial* bootloader unlock.

* The above methods are "s1tool" and will not get around "Bootloader unlock allowed: No". There doesn't seem to be a way to get around "Bootloader unlock allowed: No" except for a software+hardware box combination called SETool2 that can be used to modify any Sony Ericsson device. This is what likely what has referred to as a "paid unlock" - rendeko
== What works ==

* Building and installing to external SD card
* Display
* Touchscreen
* USB networking
* Xwayland

== What does not work ==

* Plasma Mobile
* Hardware accelerated graphics
* Audio
* Bluetooth
* GPS
* Camera
* Mobile data
* Phone calls

Note that Wi-Fi and osk-sdl are untested and may require further work.

== Additional info ==

* Page size may need to be adjusted in the future, as it is non-standard and presents a non-fatal error.

* [http://www.flashtool.net/ Xperia Flashtool] that should probably work once it is unlocked. With [https://github.com/Androxyde/Flashtool source code!]
* [https://github.com/LegacyHuawei/local_manifests/issues/9#issuecomment-168169631 there's possibly also a 3.10 branch in the wild]
