=== Instalation ===
Install chromium package from alpine. 

=== Configure startup (scale + useragent) ===

=== On-screen keyboard ===
Currently on-screen keyboard does not work with plasma-mobile (see [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/issues/108]).
You may install this extension to get a virtual keyboard nevertheless (though it does not work with every website):
