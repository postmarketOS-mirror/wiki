This page explains how to make chromium usable in mobile UIs like plasma-mobile.

=== Instalation ===
Install chromium package from alpine. 

=== Configure startup (scale + useragent) ===
Edit  '''/usr/share/applications/chromium.desktop''' and set the following line:

''Exec= GDK_SCALE=3 chromium-browser %U --start-maximized  --user-agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 4.4.2; Nexus 5 Build/KOT49H) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/32.0.1700.99 Mobile Safari/537.36"''

You may adapt scale and useragent to your needs.

=== On-screen keyboard ===
Currently on-screen keyboard does not work with plasma-mobile (see [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/issues/108]).
You may install this extension to get a virtual keyboard nevertheless (though it does not work with every website):
