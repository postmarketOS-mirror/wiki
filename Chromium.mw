This page explains how to make chromium usable in mobile UIs like plasma-mobile.

=== Installation ===
Install chromium package from alpine. 

=== Configure startup (scale + useragent) ===
Edit  '''/usr/share/applications/chromium.desktop''' and set the following line:

<source lang="C">Exec= GDK_SCALE=3 chromium-browser %U --start-maximized  --user-agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 4.4.2; Nexus 5 Build/KOT49H) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/32.0.1700.99 Mobile Safari/537.36"</source>

You may adapt scale and useragent to your needs.

=== On-screen keyboard ===
Currently on-screen keyboard does not work with plasma-mobile (see [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/issues/108]).
You may install this extension to get a virtual keyboard nevertheless (though it does not work with every website):

*https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/virtual-keyboard/pflmllfnnabikmfkkaddkoolinlfninn
*https://github.com/xontab/chrome-virtual-keyboard

=== Scroll-bar ===
Access "chrome://flags". To do that type it in the plasma-mobile search bar (on home screen), and then copy and paste it in the chromium url bar.

Enable the following flags:
*Smooth Scrolling
*Overlay Scrollbars
*Scroll prediction

This will allow to have a good scrolling experience, and hide scrollbar, so that it does not take screen-space.
