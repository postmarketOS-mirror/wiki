* booting
* everything else

== How to enter flash mode ==
* '''Recovery''': With the device powered off, hold Home + Volume Up + Power.
* '''Download''': With the device powered off, hold Home + Volume Down + Power.
Sometimes, to enter Recovery it is needed to first enter Download mode, then again hold Home + Volume Down + Power and while screen goes blank, switch to hold Home + Volume Up + Power.

== Unlocking ==
In Android go to settings -> System -> About phone and tap the build number 7 times. Then go to settings -> system -> developer options and enable OEM unlocking

== Installation ==
* had problems with "heimdall flash --KERNEL ..." command used by "pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel", it did stop with "ERROR: Partition "KERNEL" does not exist in the specified PIT."
* so did flash via TWRP recovery zip file, but after trying to boot: no screen output, no connectivity.
