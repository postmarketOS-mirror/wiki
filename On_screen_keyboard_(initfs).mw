This is an application developed by the postmarketOS community to unlock the LUKS volume in the beginning of the boot process. It implements an password box and on-screen keyboard directly on the linux framebuffer (and also any of the other backends supported by SDL2).

It is written in C++11 and uses libcryptsetup directly to unlock the partitions.
