== What works ==
* Flash System
* Flash kernel

== What does not work ==
* screen is blank
* no network
* unknown UART pinout
(so basically we can't be sure that it boots, but it seems to stay powered on)

== How to enter flash mode ==
* Power off the phone
* Press volume up
* Keep volume up pressed, and connect the phone to the computer
* wait until the LED turns blue, then release volume up (this can take a few seconds)

== How to turn off the phone ==
Since you can't remove the battery without opening the phone, you can do the following instead:
* Long press volume up + power button
* press the "off" button behind the SIM/SD card cover with a pin. This breaks the battery connection, so USB needs to be unplugged as well.
