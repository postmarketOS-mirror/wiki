== What works ==
* Flash System
* Flash kernel
* USB Network
* Screen
* Touch (<code>/dev/input/event0</code>)
* Flashlight (<code>/sys/devices/qcom,camera-led-flash.74/leds/torch-light/brightness</code>

== What does not work ==
* no Wifi/GSM
* unknown UART pinout
* Audio

== What has not been tested ==
* Compass, accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS, light sensor
* Bluetooth, NFC
* Camera

== How to enter flash mode ==
* Power off the phone
* Press volume up
* Keep volume up pressed, and connect the phone to the computer
* wait until the LED turns blue, then release volume up (this can take a few seconds)

== How to turn off the phone ==
Since you can't remove the battery without opening the phone, you can do the following instead:
* Long press volume up + power button
* press the "off" button behind the SIM/SD card cover with a pin. This breaks the battery connection, so USB needs to be unplugged as well.

== Misc ==
The device shares the <code>yukon</code> platform with other Xperia devices, such as the Xperia E3 (Flamingo), M2 (Eagle) and T2 Ultra (Tianchi). As such, the kernel likely works on all of these.
