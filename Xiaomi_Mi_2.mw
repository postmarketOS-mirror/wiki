== How to enter flash mode ==

<code>Volume Down</code> + <code>Power</code>, it will look like this:

== Progress ==

In [https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/merge_requests/168 !168] I used outdated cm11 kernel from [https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_xiaomi_aries LineageOS], it boots fine but I wasn't able to get the display working.

Then I switched to the kernel which is still maintained by [https://github.com/GuaiYiHu GuaiYiHu] from [https://github.com/MoKee/android_kernel_xiaomi_aries/ MoKee]. By following the steps on [[Troubleshooting:display]] and [[Tuning_sysfs]], the display was enabled.
