== Introduction ==
{{note|Please have realistic expectations: Booting mainline even if nothing else is working is already a great achievement!}}

This guide will walk you through mainlining your device. Starting by collecting all required information, setting up your build environment and picking a mentor that will guide you through the tricky parts. For the devices where this will work, you should be fine with basic shell knowledge, and you will be rewarded with learning a lot of new stuff and possibly booting the mainline kernel on your device!

== Materials to look into ==
This section include many useful sources to help you with mainlining as possible.

== Requirements ==
=== postmarketOS port ===
To make the instructions easier, this guide assumes that postmarketOS was already ported with a downstream kernel to your device, and that you can [[USB_Network|enter a shell after it booted via USB]] (SSH or telnet). Downstream kernels are the ones from the vendor, that ship with the device, and all derivatives from that (e.g. your typical Android / LineageOS ROM). You can check if it was ported already on the [[devices]] page, and start a [[Porting_guide|new port]] if necessary.

! note: an existing port with downstream kernel is not a hard dependency, it may take less effort overall to skip that depending on the state of the codebase.

=== Mentor ===
The mainlining process varies greatly for each device, which means we can't just write down straight forward instructions here. But luckily there are skilled people who have a bigger picture of a specific [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip SoC] and they know how to help you out efficiently. Head over to your device's wiki page (as linked in the [[devices|device overview]]) and look at the chipset the device has (infobox on the top right).

{| class="wikitable"

|-
| Tegra
| [[Matrix_and_IRC|#postmarketOS-mainline]], ask @okias, ##tegra on Freenode
|}

Make sure that your SoC is in the list (if it isn't then we don't have an easy way for mainlining right now, sorry). Let's do some more preparation now, so everything is in place before you kindly ask your mentor to help you with the process.

=== Cooperative firmware ===
Some firmware, especially bootloader, trustzone etc., doesn't play nice with mainline kernel. That is because it may require ugly hacks in the kernel, courtesy of being disgustingly broken. Those ugly hacks will not be accepted into mainline, because the proper solution would be to fix the firmware, regardless of the fact that the freedom to do that was taken away from you thanks to signature verification.

For example, a device shipping with 32bit kernel or even 64bit kernel with aforementioned ugly hacks, is likely to not support PSCI, the only mainline-approved way of CPU power management (including SMP) on aarch64. Considering this relies on trustzone cooperation, which is as far from being under your control as it possibly can, you're probably out of luck unless you a) implement said ugly hacks or b) manage to exploit your device and supply a proper trustzone

Only if we campaign for the Freedom to run our own software on the devices we own, we will be able to replace the firmware with an open one, shall one emerge.

== Preparation ==
=== Serial cable ===
It is recommended to have a working [[Serial_debugging|serial cable]] for your device. In case you can not make one, it might be possible to [[Mainlining_FAQ#Writing_dmesg_to_RAM_and_reading_it_out_after_reboot|use a workaround]] for retrieving log messages but that isn't straight forward.

=== pmbootstrap setup ===
If you have not done this already, please download and initialize <code>pmbootstrap</code>. You can stay with the defaults, just make sure to select the right device, and (to save you some time) <code>none</code> as user interface. Replace <code>~/code</code> with the path where you would like to store the source code.
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ cd ~/code
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap
$ cd pmbootstrap
$ alias pmbootstrap=$PWD/pmbootstrap.py
$ pmbootstrap init
</syntaxhighlight>

Generate an initramfs with the debug-shell hook:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap initfs hook_add debug-shell
$ pmbootstrap export
</syntaxhighlight>

=== Kernel ===
{{note|The kernel source code is several gigabytes in size, this will take a while!}}
Download a copy of <code>linux-next</code>:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ cd ~/code
$ git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git linux
$ cd linux
</syntaxhighlight>

If you have already checked out the regular linux repository, you can add the <code>linux-next</code> branch as follows:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ cd ~/code/linux
$ git remote add linux-next https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git
$ git fetch --tags linux-next
$ git checkout -b development linux-next/master
</syntaxhighlight>

After running the commands of one of the two blocks above, add a new branch for your device (replace <code>lg-mako</code> with your device's name):
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ cd ~/code/linux
$ git checkout -b "device-lg-mako"
</syntaxhighlight>

=== envkernel.sh ===
Usually when compiling a kernel, you would install [https://kernelnewbies.org/KernelBuild all dependencies] and a cross compiler in your host system. To make it easier, we have the <code>envkernel.sh</code> script (for fish shell: <code>envkernel.fish</code>). It sets up an Alpine Linux chroot with all the dependencies by using <code>pmbootstrap</code> internally, exports the environment variables to use the right cross compiler and creates an alias to <code>make</code>. This means, whenever you type <code>make</code> after sourcing that script, it will actually run <code>make</code> in the chroot. Please try the script out once to make sure everything is working as expected:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
(enter the directory where you have cloned the linux kernel source)
$ cd ~/code/linux
$ source ~/code/pmbootstrap/helpers/envkernel.sh

envkernel.sh has grown to be quite powerful, read more about it at the [[compiling kernels with envkernel.sh]] wiki page.

=== Got everything? ===
Please double check with the following checklist that you meet '''all the requirements''' before proceeding further. If you need any help with the above, just ask [[Matrix_and_IRC|in the channel]] or [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues on GitHub] as usually.

* [[#Serial_cable|Serial cable]] (or suitable workaround)
* [[#pmbootstrap setup|Device ported to postmarketOS]]
* [[#Mentor|Mentor]]
* [[#pmbootstrap setup|Initramfs with debug-shell generated]]
* [[#envkernel.sh|envkernel.sh test run]]

== Contact your mentor ==
Hop on [[Matrix_and_IRC|Matrix or IRC]] and ask the mentor if they have time to walk you through the further steps. This should be obvious, but remember to be nice and understanding if the mentor does not have time right away, they are supporting you for free so you'll need to be grateful and patient.

The following steps are meant to be taken together with the mentor.

== Device Tree Source ==
The [[DTS]] file describes how the peripherals of the device are connected to the SoC. [[Device_Tree_(dtb)#Writing_a_device_tree | Here]] is a short description of the process you are guided through here.

=== Start with an existing file ===
Your mentor probably knows which file you should use to start your work on. This may either be a file in the existing Linux source tree, or a file your mentor uploaded somewhere.

Example for copying an existing file:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ cd ~/code/linux/arch/arm/boot/dts
$ cp qcom-apq8064-asus-nexus7-flo.dts qcom-apq8064-lge-nexus4-mako.dts
</syntaxhighlight>

Let's commit that directly, so it will be easy to see what you have changed later on by running <code>git diff</code> (adjust the description of the commit accordingly):
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Starting with: qcom-apq8064-asus-nexus7-flo.dts"
</syntaxhighlight>

=== Adjust model and compatible ===
Open the DTS file in an editor and replace the <code>model</code> and <code>compatible</code> strings at the top of the file:

<syntaxhighlight lang="c">
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0
#include "qcom-apq8064-v2.0.dtsi"
#include <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h>
#include <dt-bindings/input/input.h>
#include <dt-bindings/pinctrl/qcom,pmic-gpio.h>
/ {
	model = "Asus Nexus7(flo)";
	compatible = "asus,nexus7-flo", "qcom,apq8064";

// ...
</syntaxhighlight>

In the example, we replace <code>model</code> with <code>"LGE Nexus4 (mako)"</code> and the first string after compatible with <code>"lge,nexus4-mako</code> (we leave the second string in place, as this is the name of the SoC, which is the same).

And again, let's commit this change. It's recommended to commit after every change you make to the DTS files so you can revert easily to the last known working state if necessary:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Adjusted model and compatible"
</syntaxhighlight>

! caveat: 
The right compatible values can be found in downstream dts. You may however find something unexpected.

In the following example (sm-a300fu), msm8916-mtp is used, which will result in the wrong dts being selected unless you copy <code>qcom,board-id = <0xCE08FF01 1>;</code> as well. Unfortunately, this board-id is shared between several Samsung phones, but considering they only bundle the one dtb a particular model uses, we can be grateful there even is a board-id. A solution has not been decided upon yet. (18. 3. 2019)

<syntaxhighlight lang="c">
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0
/dts-v1/;

#include "msm8916-samsung-a300fu.dtsi"

/ {
	model = "Samsung Galaxy A3 sm-a300fu";
	compatible = "qcom,msm8916-mtp", "qcom,msm8916", "qcom,mtp";
	qcom,board-id = <0xCE08FF01 1>;
};
</syntaxhighlight>

=== Minimal booting version ===
Your mentor will instruct you how to modify the file further, so you have a minimal configuration that allows you to boot into the mainline kernel if everything went right. Almost nothing will work at this point, except for initializing RAM and serial output. We will work our way to enabling one feature after another throughout the process.

== Adjust DTS Makefile ==
Open <code>arch/arm/boot/dts/Makefile</code> in an editor and add one line for your new device tree. First find the right location by searching for the prefix in the file (e.g. all <code>qcom-</code> lines are in the <code>dtb-$(CONFIG_ARCH_QCOM) += \</code> section). Then insert the name of your <code>dts</code> file there, but use <code>dtb</code> as extenssion and don't forget the backslash <code>\</code> at the end of the line. Save, check the diff (it should be similar to the one below) and commit your change:

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ git diff
diff --git a/arch/arm/boot/dts/Makefile b/arch/arm/boot/dts/Makefile
index 3b4cc1b64a1e..af74d95b63fa 100644

        qcom-apq8084-mtp.dtb \
$ git add arch/arm/boot/dts/Makefile
$ git commit -m "Enable my new DTS in the Makefile"
</syntaxhighlight>

== Testing ==
=== Defconfig and compilation ===
Ask your mentor for the right defconfig to use. Then configure the kernel to use the defconfig and finally build it. Example:

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ cd ~/code/linux
$ source ~/code/pmbootstrap/helpers/envkernel.sh
$ make qcom_defconfig
$ make -j5
</syntaxhighlight>



=== Execute on the device ===
This greatly depends on your device, and you can figure out the correct method by looking at your [[deviceinfo]] and at the <code>postmarketos-mkinitfs</code> code if necessary. But typically for fastboot based Android devices, you can patch the <code>boot.img</code> and boot it as follows.

==== Patch boot.img ====
Prepare your current shell session once:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap chroot -- apk add abootimg android-tools mkbootimg dtbtool
$ export DEVICE="$(pmbootstrap config device)"
$ export WORK="$(pmbootstrap config work)"
$ export TEMP="$WORK/chroot_native/tmp/mainline/"
$ mkdir -p "$TEMP"
</syntaxhighlight>

Then run one of the following every time you would like to replace the kernel inside the <code>boot.img</code> file. The non-[[QCDT]] version is easier, so check if you have a QCDT or not in the <code>deviceinfo</code> first.

===== non-QCDT devices =====
Now append the DTB (device tree blob), which has been generated from your DTS file, to the kernel, then create a bootimage from it. Replace <code>qcom-apq8064-lge-nexus4-mako</code> accordingly, and mind the <code>dtb</code> at the end instead of <code>dts</code>:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ cd ~/code/linux/.output/arch/arm/boot
$ cat zImage dts/qcom-apq8064-lge-nexus4-mako.dtb > ~/code/linux/.zImage-dtb
$ cp ~/code/linux/.zImage-dtb "$TEMP"/zImage-dtb
$ cp "/tmp/postmarketOS-export/boot.img-$DEVICE" "$TEMP/boot.img"
$ pmbootstrap chroot
# abootimg -u /tmp/mainline/boot.img  -k /tmp/mainline/zImage-dtb
reading kernel from /tmp/mainline/zImage-dtb
Writing Boot Image /tmp/mainline/boot.img
# exit
[20:00:00] Done
</syntaxhighlight>
If you are getting
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
/tmp/mainline/boot.img: updated is too big for the Boot Image (7323648 vs 5853184 bytes)
</syntaxhighlight>
error, and it can fit on boot partition, add '''-c "bootsize=<boot partition size>"''' to abootimg command:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
# abootimg -u /tmp/mainline/boot.img  -k /tmp/mainline/zImage-dtb -c "bootsize=12582912"
</syntaxhighlight>

===== QCDT devices =====
All flasher offsets must be replaced with the values from the [[deviceinfo]] (you might want to save the command as a shell script for quick usage).
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ cp ~/code/linux/.output/arch/arm/boot/zImage  "$TEMP"/zImage
$ cp "/tmp/postmarketOS-export/boot.img-$DEVICE" "$TEMP/boot.img"
$ cp "/tmp/postmarketOS-export/initramfs-$DEVICE" "$TEMP/initramfs"
$ $WORK/chroot_native/usr/bin/dtbTool -s 2048 -p ~/code/linux/scripts/dtc/ -o "$TEMP/dt.img" ~/code/linux/.output/arch/arm/boot/dts
$ pmbootstrap chroot -- mkbootimg-osm0sis \
--kernel "/tmp/mainline/zImage" \
--ramdisk "/tmp/mainline/initramfs" \
--dt "/tmp/mainline/dt.img" \
--base "0x00000000" \
--second_offset "0x00f00000" \
--cmdline "console=ttyMSM0,115200,n8 PMOS_NO_OUTPUT_REDIRECT" \
--kernel_offset "0x00008000" \
--ramdisk_offset "0x02000000" \
--tags_offset "0x01e00000" \
--pagesize "2048" \
-o "/tmp/mainline/boot.img"
</syntaxhighlight>

==== Boot ====
First start <code>dmesg -w</code> (see below). Then bring your device into fastboot mode, connect it via USB and boot (or flash) the kernel:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap flasher list_devices
$ pmbootstrap chroot -- fastboot boot /tmp/mainline/boot.img
</syntaxhighlight>

The <code>list_devices</code> line instructs <code>pmbootstrap</code> to mount the USB device nodes inside the chroot, so without this line being executed at least once in the session, fastboot will not find any devices (see {{github|1345}}).

=== dmesg on your PC ===
Before booting the first time, run <code>dmesg -w</code> on your PC. If everything went right, you should see something like the following as soon as the device boots:

<pre>
[27166.665566] usb 3-9: new high-speed USB device number 16 using xhci_hcd
[27166.793111] usb 3-9: New USB device found, idVendor=0525, idProduct=a4a7

</pre>

= TODO =
* Mention this is ARM only
* Explain how to get dmesg from the device via telnet (<code>dhcpcd interface --nohook ipv6</code> might be necessary etc.)
* Add steps to upstream the changes made into the kernel (there are already good tutorials out there)
* Add step to integrate the changes with the pmbootstrap source tree (might need changes in pmbootstrap architecture for that)
* Describe how to add a "Mainline section" to each device specific page (with a template!) - something like [http://elektranox.org/droid4/ this overview] would be great to have for every device. This can be done while doing the first kernel compilation when following this guide, because that takes a while anyway. Get the components from:
** downstream dts or teardown results like from ifixit
** decipher from downstream dmesg
** <code>grep compatible</code> in downstream DTS decompiled also works
