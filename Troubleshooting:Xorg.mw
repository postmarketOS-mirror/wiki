If your X11 server is not working, check the {{alpine|syslog}} with <code>logread</code> and the <code>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</code> files via SSH for helpful messages.

== Strange refresh rate ==
Android devices seem to usually have a refresh rate of 60 Hz. If you have a very high or low refresh rate, that does not make any sense, try the patch from {{github|348}}. If that also fails, try to add a [https://www.x.org/wiki/FAQVideoModes/#index3h2 X11 modeline] with the correct refresh rate.

== Output isn't displayed right for other reasons ==
Try the patches from [[Troubleshooting:display]].

== Other ideas ==
If Weston is working, but X11 is not, you could try [https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=185297 Xweston] to simply run your X11 desktop completely inside Weston.
