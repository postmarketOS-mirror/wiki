If your X11 server is not working, check the {{alpine|syslog}} with <code>logread</code> and the <code>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</code> files via SSH for helpful messages.

== X11 segfault ==
Example output from running XFCE4:
<pre>
(xfwm4:2538): xfwm4-WARNING **: Cannot find visual format on screen 0
(EE) Segmentation fault at address 0x4
(EE) 
Fatal server error:
(EE) Caught signal 11 (Segmentation fault). Server aborting
</pre>
This might get fixed with [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/master/aports/device/linux-huawei-y530/06_fix_mdss_fb_rgb_mode.patch 06_fix_mdss_fb_rgb_mode.patch] (see {{github|779}}).

== Strange refresh rate ==
Android devices seem to usually have a refresh rate of 60 Hz. If you have a very high or low refresh rate, that does not make any sense, try the patch from {{github|348}}. If that also fails, try to add a [https://www.x.org/wiki/FAQVideoModes/#index3h2 X11 modeline] with the correct refresh rate.

== Output isn't displayed right for other reasons ==
Try the patches from [[Troubleshooting:display]].

== Is TWRP working? ==
Try to compare its framebuffer output code with xf86-video-fbdev. If you go down this road, please expand this idea with more information.

== Use Xweston instead ==
If Weston is working, but X11 is not, you could try [https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=185297 Xweston] to simply run your X11 desktop completely inside Weston. Currently, that is only an idea with implementation work beginning in {{github|909}}.
