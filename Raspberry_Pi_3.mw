== Installation ==

1. Follow the steps on [[Installation_guide#Initialization]]

2. Choose the <code>raspberry-pi3</code> device

3. Start the build process and install the completed image to a sdcard
<source lang="shell-session">
$ ./pmbootstrap.py install --sdcard /dev/sdX
(replace /dev/sdX with the device for your sdcard)
</source>
4. Place the sdcard into the Raspberry Pi and boot it

== Features ==

=== Audio ===

The audio is configured to be sent to the HDMI port by default.

If you want to use the onboard jack you have to run this command:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ amixer cset numid=3 1
(test the output with)
$ speaker-test -c 2
(change output back to HDMI)
$ amixer cset numid=3 2
</source>
