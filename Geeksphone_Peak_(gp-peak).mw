udev does not work correctly so we have to [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/master/aports/device/linux-gp-peak/linux-gp-peak.start trigger rules manually].

Also the device freezes after a few minutes. This seems to be caused by a modem failure:
<pre>
Jan  1 01:59:59 localhost kern.err kernel: [  574.209688] SMSM: Modem SMSM state changed to SMSM_RESET.
Jan  1 01:59:59 localhost kern.err kernel: [  574.209948] Notify: start reset
</pre>

== How to enter flash mode ==
Press both volume keys + power key until you see the Geeksphone logo.
