udev does not work correctly so we have to [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/416c1109a4769c7493a33beedb3762e138a328e5/aports/device/device-gp-peak/device-gp-peak.start#L2 trigger rules manually].

<code>poweroff</code>/<code>reboot</code> does not work correctly, it stops all the services but does not shutdown the device.

Also the device freezes after a few minutes. This seems to be caused by a modem failure:
<pre>
Jan  1 01:59:59 localhost kern.err kernel: [  574.209688] SMSM: Modem SMSM state changed to SMSM_RESET.
Jan  1 01:59:59 localhost kern.err kernel: [  574.209948] Notify: start reset
</pre>

== How to enter flash mode ==
Press both volume keys + power key until you see the Geeksphone logo.
