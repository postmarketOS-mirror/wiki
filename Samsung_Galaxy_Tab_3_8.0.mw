== How to enter flash mode ==
Download mode: VolDown while powering on

Recovery mode: VolUp while powering on

== Installation ==
So far only flashable ZIP installation has been tested. ADB Sideload via TWRP did not want to cooperate. 

1. Install TWRP.

2. Download zip file (todo: upload ZIP)

3. If mounted, unmount /system.

4. Flash the ZIP as usual.

== Notes ==
Only lt01wifi/T310 has been tested so far. I might make builds for T311 and T315 once I get T310 working.

The device indicates when it's charging, but the actual batery percentage readings don't work.
