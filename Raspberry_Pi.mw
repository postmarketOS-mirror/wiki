== Installation ==
1. Init pmbootstrap <source lang="shell-session">$ ./pmbootstrap.py init</source>
::* Choose <code>raspberry-pi3</code> for the Raspberry 3B and 3B+ (aarch64 installation)
::* Choose <code>raspberry-pi0</code> for the Raspberry Zero (armhf installation)
::* Choose <code>raspberry-pi</code> for all other versions (armhf installation)
2. Select the kernel for your Raspberry Pi version <source lang="shell-session">
[10:47:03] Which kernel do you want to use with your device?
[10:47:03] Available kernels (2):
[10:47:03] * rpi: Kernel for the Raspberry Pi 1
[10:47:03] * rpi2: Kernel for the Raspberry Pi 2 & 3
</source>
3. Optionally add <code>bluetooth-raspberry-pi</code> as extra package. It will install a service that starts the built-in bluetooth device at boot. <source lang="shell-session">
[17:14:37] Additional packages that will be installed to rootfs. Specify them in a comma separated list (e.g.: vim,file) or "none"
[17:14:37] Extra packages [none]: bluetooth-raspberry-pi
</source>
4. Start the build process and install the completed image to a sdcard <source lang="shell-session">
$ ./pmbootstrap.py install --sdcard /dev/sdX
(replace /dev/sdX with the device for your sdcard)</source>
5. Place the sdcard into the Raspberry Pi and boot it
