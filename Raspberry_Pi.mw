The Raspberry Pi has a [https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi pre-existing port of Alpine Linux].

It should be possible to [[Existing Alpine installation|convert the pre-existing RPi Alpine install to a pmOS install]].

== postmarketOS device package ==
{{note|We'd be happy if you own a Raspberry Pi and want to integrate it properly. Let us know in the [[Matrix_and_IRC|chat]] if you need any help!}}
As of now, there is no device package, only the existing Alpine installation has been converted. But it should be not that hard to do. Rough notes on how it should be possible:
* <code>pmbootstrap init</code>, create a new device aport
* delete the generated aports/device/linux-* folder (check with <code>git status</code>)
* change the device APKBUILD to use Alpine's raspberry pi kernel instead
* add a new [[deviceinfo]] option for the boot partition type (default is ext2 as we do it now, for the pi it needs to be fat)
* adjust pmbootstrap code to use that variable
* test the installation with an sd card
* make a pull request
