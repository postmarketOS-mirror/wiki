== NOTE ==

None of this work has been (merged/pushed/get correct terminology) upstream. Contact CmdrWgls on IRC if you're interested in working on it before he gets around to actually doing so.

rrooij uploaded his progress here: https://github.com/rrooij/pmbootstrap/tree/device-asus-tf101

== What works ==

* Compiling the kernel

== What does not work ==

* Flashing it, the recovery zip fails and pmbootstrap doesn't support nvflash

== Progress ==

=== What's been done ===

* device-asus-tf101 builds
* linux-asus-tf101 builds

=== What's been attempted ===

* Tried to build two kernels.

==== [https://github.com/timduru/tf101-katkernel timduru's KatKiss kernel] ====
Builds failed due to <code>devtmpfs</code> not being used in the Android ROM this was taken from. It appears to be missing code related to <code>kern_path_create</code>. See:
* <code>dev/drivers/base/devtmpfs.c</code> <- source of error
* <code>include/linux/namei.h</code> <- place where <code>kern_path_create</code> is defined in more recent kernels but apparently not in this one
* another file I've forgotten ...
Attempted to fix by copying the declarations for <code>kern_path_create</code> from the mainline kernel. Fix failed because this was much too small a change to solve the problem.

==== [https://github.com/novaspirit/tf101-linux-2.6.36 novaspirit's kernel] ====
Fails, multiple definitions of <code>return address</code> found in several files under <code>arch/arm/kernel</code>. No effort has been made yet to solve this problem, so this kernel is still in contention.

==== [https://github.com/jmrohwer/TF101-GNU-kernel jmrohwer's kernel] ====

Works after applying patches.

== Next steps ==

Try to flash the kernel and system
