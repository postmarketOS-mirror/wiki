== What works ==

* Compiling the kernel
* Booting in Weston

== What does not work ==

* Flashing normally, since the device uses nvflash, a proprietary flashing protocol
* USB Networking
* Touch

== Installation ==

You have to flash a recovery like TWRP before doing this. You also have to use this tool: [https://github.com/AndroidRoot/BlobTools]

# <pre>./pmbootstrap.py install --no-fde</pre>
# <pre>./pmbootstrap.py export</pre>
# Reboot the device in recovery
# <pre>./blobpack blob /tmp/postmarketOS-export/boot.img-asus-tf101 LNX</pre>
# <pre>adb push blob /cache</pre>
# <pre>adb push /tmp/postmarketOS-export/asus-tf101.img</pre>

The following should be executed within adb shell:

# <pre>adb shell</pre>
# <pre>dd if=/cache/blob of=/dev/block/mmcblk0p4</pre>
# <pre>dd if=/cache/asus-tf101.img of=/dev/block/mmcblk0p1</pre>
