You have to flash a recovery like TWRP before doing this. You also have to use this tool: [https://github.com/AndroidRoot/BlobTools]

# <pre>./pmbootstrap.py install --no-fde</pre>
# <pre>./pmbootstrap.py export</pre>
# Reboot the device in recovery
# <pre>./blobpack blob /tmp/postmarketOS-export/boot.img-asus-tf101 LNX</pre> (<code>LNX</code> is the partition name, this is not a placeholder [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1103#issuecomment-356984400])
# <pre>adb push blob /cache</pre>
# <pre>adb push /tmp/postmarketOS-export/asus-tf101.img</pre>

The following should be executed within adb shell:

# <pre>adb shell</pre>
# <pre>dd if=/cache/blob of=/dev/block/mmcblk0p4</pre>
# <pre>dd if=/cache/asus-tf101.img of=/dev/block/mmcblk0p1</pre>
