= Changing the kernel configuration =
You can change the kernel configuration with pmbootstrap, for the linux-sony-yuga package for example we run:

<pre class="shell">pmbootstrap kconfig edit sony-yuga</pre>

This gives you a menu where you can select and deselect all kernel configuration options. Press the <code>/</code> key to get a search dialog. After finding something, type the number of the search result to quickly jump to it.

[[File:KernelConfig.png|800px]]

If you don't like the terminal user interface, you can also use <code>pmbootstrap kconfig edit -x</code> or <code>pmbootstrap kconfig edit -g</code>. See <code>pmbootstrap kconfig edit -h</code> for details.

== Options aren't always visible! ==
If you're looking for an option and you just can't find it, then it might not show up because it depends on other options that have been disabled. In that case, press <code>/</code> and search for the option in question. You will see the dependencies. Then use the search again to find these dependencies, and enable them until you can finally enable the option you wanted to change in the first place.

= Useful kernel configuration options =

== Required to be enabled/disabled ==

Enable or disable the following options to get postmarketOS working. Use <code>pmbootstrap kconfig check</code> to check which options need to be modified.

=== CONFIG_DEVTMPFS ===

'''About'''

''This adds support for the devtmpfs filesystem which should be mounted to /dev at startup. The kernel driver core creates device nodes for all registered devices in that filesystem. All device nodes are owned by root and have the default mode of 0600. Userspace can add and delete the nodes as needed.''

</pre>

'''pmOS specific'''

This should always be set, otherwise you get this when you try SSH:

<pre>PTY allocation request failed on channel 0
-ash: a: unknown operand</pre>

=== CONFIG_VT ===

'''About'''

''If you say Y here, you will get support for terminal devices with display and keyboard devices. These are called "virtual" because you can run several virtual terminals (also called virtual consoles) on one physical terminal. This is rather useful, for example one virtual terminal can collect system messages and warnings, another one can be used for a text-mode user session, and a third could run an X session, all in parallel. Switching between virtual terminals is done with certain key combinations, usually Alt-<function key>.''

=== CONFIG_EXT4_FS ===

'''About'''

''This is the next generation of the ext3 filesystem.''

'''Location in menu'''

<pre class="shell">
File systems -->
  The Extended 4 (ext4) filesystem
</pre>

'''pmOS specific'''

This should always be set since pmbootstrap creates an ext4 rootfs.

=== CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER ===

'''About'''

''The uevent helper program is forked by the kernel for every uevent. Before the switch to the netlink-based uevent source, this was used to hook hotplug scripts into kernel device events. It usually pointed to a shell script at /sbin/hotplug. This should not be used today, because usual systems create many events at bootup or device discovery in a very short time frame. One forked process per event can create so many processes that it creates a high system load, or on smaller systems it is known to create out-of-memory situations during bootup.''

'''pmOS specific'''

This option should always be enabled on pmos kernels that are 3.16+, it's the config option that makes /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug appear.

=== CONFIG_KERNEL_GZIP, CONFIG_KERNEL_XZ, CONFIG_KERNEL_LZO and CONFIG_KERNEL_LZMA ===

'''About'''

;GZIP
:  ''The old and tried gzip compression. It provides a good balance between compression ratio and decompression speed.''
:  [https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/KERNEL_GZIP.html Read more...]
;XZ
:  ''XZ uses the LZMA2 algorithm and instruction set specific BCJ filters which can improve compression ratio of executable code. The size of the kernel is about 30% smaller with XZ in comparison to gzip. The speed is about the same as with LZMA: The decompression speed of XZ is better than that of bzip2 but worse than gzip and LZO. Compression is slow.''
:  [https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/KERNEL_XZ.html Read more...]
;LZO
:  ''Its compression ratio is the poorest among the choices. The kernel size is about 10% bigger than gzip; however its speed (both compression and decompression) is the fastest.''
:  [https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/KERNEL_LZO.html Read more...]
;LZMA
:  ''This compression algorithm's ratio is best. Decompression speed is between gzip and bzip2. Compression is slowest. The kernel size is about 33% smaller with LZMA in comparison to gzip.''

<pre class="shell>
General Setup -->
  Kernel compression mode -->
    Gzip
    LZMA
    XZ
    LZO
</pre>

'''pmOS specific'''

You should set one of these to Y.
* Gzip: Works without specifying anything else.
* LZMA: If kernel compilation fails with this compression type, read [[Troubleshooting:kernel#Kernel_compilation:_BusyBox_lzma_compression_fails]].
* XZ: Make sure to add <code>xz</code> to <code>makedepends</code> in the APKBUILD of your kernel package.
* LZO: If you get <code>lzop: high compression not compiled in</code> during compilation of the kernel you probably need [https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/b4c9f93f0d7be1272f6a67de2128558ce58e1077/aports/linux-samsung-i9070/02_reduce_lzo_compression.patch this patch].

=== CONFIG_ANDROID_PARANOID_NETWORK ===

'''About'''

''Android adds a "paranoid network" option to the Linux kernel, which restricts access to some networking features depending on the group of the calling process. The list of groups that are allowed access to networking features is in the kernel source file: /include/linux/android_aids.h 
Setting this config will enable the paranoid network security feature''

[https://elinux.org/Android_Security#Paranoid_network-ing Read more...]

'''Location in menu'''

<pre class="shell">
Networking Support -->
  Networking Options -->
    Only allow certain groups to create sockets
</pre>

'''Android specific'''

This option should '''not''' be set in pmOS or any other OS not using Android security model.


=== CONFIG_PFT===

'''About'''

''This caused builds to fail with a modern GCC at least once, and while it originally was meant as security feature by Qualcomm, "it is unsupported by Qualcomm, and opens up to a wide range of potential attack surfaces that has not been audited by anyone." [http://www.merproject.org/logs/%23sailfishos-porters/%23sailfishos-porters.2016-08-26.log.html#t2016-08-26T17:43:06].''

'''Location in menu'''

<pre class="shell">
Device Drivers -->
  Qualcomm MSM specific device drivers -->
    Per-File-Tagger driver
</pre>

'''pmOS specific'''

Please disable it, so we have one less source for failing builds and enabling it has no benefit anyway.


=== CONFIG_SYSVIPC ===

'''Location in menu'''

<pre class="shell">
General Setup -->
  System V IPC
</pre>

'''pmOS specific'''

Please enable it for postmarketOS, so busybox' syslogd can log to a ringbuffer in the kernel (fixes {{github|808}}).

=== CONFIG_USE_VFB===

'''About'''

''Weston and Plasma Mobile might choose to draw on this virtual frame buffer, just like it happened for the samsung-jflte ({{issue|34|pmaports}}). Disabling the USE_VFB option fixed this, so let's make sure we don't have that option enabled for any kernel.''

'''Location in menu'''

<pre class="shell">
Device Drivers -->
  Graphics supports -->
    MSM Framebuffer support -->
      MSM Virtual Framebuffer support
</pre>

'''pmOS specific'''

Please disable it, so we have one less source of failure.

=== CONFIG_KINETO_GAN ===

'''About'''

''Related to a proprietary "T-Mobile's WiFi-Calling" feature. It should not affect normal calls, so it should be safe to disable it.''

'''Location in menu'''

<pre class="shell">
Device Drivers -->
  Network device support -->
    Kineto GAN virtual network interface
</pre>

'''pmOS specific'''

Causes <code>sudo</code>, <code>ip</code> and other commands to hang ({{issue|1513|pmaports}}). Please disable it.

=== CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD ===

'''About'''

''Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support''

'''Location in menu'''

<pre class="shell">
General setup -->
  Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support
</pre>

'''pmOS specific'''

Required. See {{issue|237|pmaports}} for notes about changing the initramfs compression.

== Optional ==

These kernel options are optional and for some devices required to fix some issues.

=== CONFIG_LBDAF ===
'''About'''

''Support for large (2TB+) block devices and files''

''The ext4 filesystem requires that this feature be enabled in order to support filesystems that have the huge_file feature enabled. Otherwise, it will refuse to mount in the read-write mode any filesystems that use the huge_file feature, which is enabled by default by mke2fs.ext4.''

'''Location in menu'''

<pre class="shell>
-*- Enable the block layer  --->
    [*]   Support for large (2TB+) block devices and files
</pre>

'''pmOS specific'''

This is recommended for all 32bit (armhf, x86) devices. The option is not present on 64bit (aarch64, x86_64) devices.

Without this option, it is not possible to mount ext4 partitions that have been created with the default settings. The postmarketOS SD card installation uses these default parameters. There doesn't seem to be a point in changing that to work around badly configured kernels: even if the postmarketOS installation did not require this option, you might come across an SD card with ext4, that does not work on your device.

=== CONFIG_USB_G_ANDROID ===
'''About'''

''The Android Composite Gadget supports multiple USB functions: adb, acm, mass storage, mtp, accessory and rndis.''

''Each function can be configured and enabled/disabled dynamically from userspace through a sysfs interface.''

'''Location in menu'''

<pre class="shell>
Device Drivers -->
  USB Support -->
    USB Gadget Support -->
      USB Gadget Drivers -->
        Android Composite Gadget
</pre>

'''pmOS specific'''

Enabling this option is needed for usb networking on some of the android kernels.

=== CONFIG_USB_ETH ===
'''About'''

''This driver implements Ethernet style communication, in one of several ways:

* ''The "Communication Device Class" (CDC) Ethernet Control Model. That protocol is often avoided with pure Ethernet adapters, in favor of simpler vendor-specific hardware, but is widely supported by firmware for smart network devices.''
* ''On hardware can't implement that protocol, a simple CDC subset is used, placing fewer demands on USB.''
* ''CDC Ethernet Emulation Model (EEM) is a newer standard that has a simpler interface that can be used by more USB hardware.''

''RNDIS support is an additional option, more demanding than than subset.''

=== CONFIG_USB_ETH_RNDIS ===
'''About'''

''Microsoft Windows XP bundles the "Remote NDIS" (RNDIS) protocol, and Microsoft provides redistributable binary RNDIS drivers for older versions of Windows.''

''If you say "y" here, the Ethernet gadget driver will try to provide a second device configuration, supporting RNDIS to talk to such Microsoft USB hosts.''
