Most Android devices have a "recovery" partition, on which a second kernel and initramfs can be installed. The recovery systems installed there allow overwriting the main OS with a special zip file, and it is possible to generate such a file for postmarketOS.

== Preparation ==
* [[Installing_pmbootstrap|Install pmbootstrap]]
* Install [https://twrp.me TWRP] (or another recovery system) on your phone

== Create the recovery zip image ==
Similar to a [[Installation_guide|regular installation]], but add <code>--android-recovery-zip</code> this time. If your device supports full disk encryption (see the FDE column in [[Devices]]), you can remove the <code>--no-fde</code> argument.

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap init
$ pmbootstrap install --no-fde --android-recovery-zip
</syntaxhighlight>

== Sideload ==
This allows downloading the zip file on the fly directly from your computer. If you don't want to sideload, you can also [[#Copy_the_generated_image_to_an_SD_card|copy the generated zip file to an SD card]].
* Boot the recovery system
* Click on "Advanced / ADB Sideload", then "Swipe to start sideload"
* Connect your phone to your PC
* Start the sideloading process from your PC

Usually this would be done with:
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap flasher --method=adb sideload # broken: #1638
</syntaxhighlight>

However, this is broken right now (see {{issue|1638}}). Read on for a workaround.

=== Sideload without pmbootstrap ===
Install <code>adb</code> on your host Linux distribution (usually in an <code>android-tools</code> package that you can install with your distribution's package manager), then run the following commands. The special <code>cd</code> is necessary, because <code>adb</code> can't resolve the symlink on its own.
<syntaxhighlight lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap export
[07:48:04] NOTE: To export the rootfs image, run 'pmbootstrap install' first (without the 'sdcard' parameter).
[07:48:07] Export symlinks to: /tmp/postmarketOS-export
[07:48:07]  * initramfs-lg-mako (Initramfs)
[07:48:07]  * boot.img-lg-mako (Fastboot compatible boot.img file, contains initramfs and kernel)
[07:48:07]  * vmlinuz-lg-mako (Linux kernel)
[07:48:07]  * pmos-lg-mako.zip (Android recovery flashable zip)
[07:48:07] NOTE: chroot is still active (use 'pmbootstrap shutdown' as necessary)
[07:48:07] Done
$ cd $(dirname $(readlink /tmp/postmarketOS-export/pmos-*.zip))
$ adb sideload pmos-lg-mako.zip
loading: 'pmos-lg-mako.zip'...
connecting...
Total xfer: 1.08x
</syntaxhighlight>

== Copy the generated image to an SD card ==
Instead of sideloading, you can run <code>pmbootstrap export</code> and copy the <code>pmos-*.zip</code> file to an SD card. Insert it into your phone, boot into the recovery system, and select "Install". Then navigate to the zip file, and the postmarketOS installation should begin.

== Rebooting ==
TWRP reports that no OS has been installed. This happens, because it can not detect postmarketOS installations ({{issue|1451}}. Just ignore it and reboot into your fresh postmarketOS installation.
