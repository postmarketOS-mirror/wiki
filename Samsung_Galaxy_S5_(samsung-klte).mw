== Users owning this device ==
{{Device owners}}

== What works ==

* Flash Kernel (<code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</code>)
* Flash Rootfs (<code>pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs</code>)
* Initramfs boot
* USB Network
* Framebuffer graphics (Splash screens)
* SSH Connectivity
* Touchscreen
* Wi-Fi
* Xwayland
* Weston on framebuffer [broken with latest weston]
* Plasma Mobile on framebuffer [untested with last update]
* X11 based UIs on framebuffer work fine
* Android container starts
* audio works with nonfree-userland (with Android container)

== What does not work ==

* Audio playback without nonfree-userland
* Bluetooth adapter is visible in rfkill list, but does not work
* Everything else

== How to enter flash mode ==

Press and hold {{button|Volume Down}} + {{button|Home}} + {{button|Power}} simultaneously. Then click {{button|Volume Up}} to confirm.

== How to enter recovery mode ==

Press and hold {{button|Volume Up}} + {{button|Home}} + {{button|Power}} simultaneously.

== Installation ==
First, [[Installing_pmbootstrap|install pmbootstrap]].

Setup device to be used:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap init
...
Vendor [samsung]: samsung <- enter this
Device codename [i9100]: klte   <- enter this
Kernel [downstream]: downstream        <- you probably want downstream for now
User interface [weston]:               <- choose any UI by your preference
...
</source>

Build the rootfs image:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap install
</source>

Then in order to flash it put your device in download mode, and plug it in USB. Then do:

<source lang="shell-session">
$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs

 Hold "Volume down" + "Home" buttons at the end of the process,
 so that when phone reboots put it in flashing mode again 

$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel

 This time, don't hold any button, let it reboot to Linux!
</source>

=== Nonfree-userland (halium) installation ===

[[File:Samsung-klte-android-running-inside-lxc-cut.png|400px|thumb|right|Android processes running inside lxc container]]

To make full use of nonfree-userland intallation, which involves running Android in lxc container to make all hardware work (read more at [[Hybris]] wiki page), you need to to '''manually'''  download and install custom device-specific Android/Halium system image. Building it manually takes a lot of time and free space on HDD, so I've prepared prebuilt image: https://androidfilehost.com/?fid=6006931924117913010

You need to download it, un-sparse and place in to root of userdata partition:

Un-sparse:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ simg2img halium-klte-2019-07-09-system.img halium-klte-2019-07-09-system.img.raw
</source>
If it says "invalid sparse format or header magic" it means that the image is already unsparsed. Proceed to next step

Reboot phone to TWRP recovery and push image using ADB:
<source lang="shell-session">
$ adb push halium-klte-2019-07-09-system.img.raw /data/system.img
</source>

Boot to a running postmarketOS system and login with SSH using [[USB_Network]]. Next commands are executed on the phone. Make sure that you have a <code>/data</code> mounted (check output of <code>mount</code> command). Ensure that Android is fully running inside an lxc container (on device, install <code>htop</code>, run it and switch into tree mode by pressing '''t''') (see the picture on the right). If it does not, check if <code>lxc-android</code> is running (see output of <code>rc-status</code> command). Run '''logcat''' and see if it is printing some error logs on the screen.

Before (re)starting lxc-android, remember to remove file <code>/tmp/lxc-android-once</code> if it exists.

== Additional info ==

=== Useful helper scripts ===
Default installation includes a couple of useful scripts to be used from a terminal: <code>battery-status</code> and <code>set-brightness</code>. <code>battery-status</code> allows you to check for battery charge level, and <code>set-brightness</code> allows to view/set lcd backlight brightness in range 0-255.
<pre>
samsung-klte:~$ battery-status 
25
samsung-klte:~$ set-brightness 
255
samsung-klte:~$ sudo set-brightness 20
20
</pre>

=== Mainlining Notes ===

==== Power IC ====

The phone uses max77804k MFD (Multi Function Device) IC to handle charging, extcon (cable detect), vibrator, flash led. This device is not in mainline, but it is very similar (i.e the same) to max77693 in register layout. In the next paragraph I'll refer to max77804k code as downstream and max77693 code as upstream.

* '''Charging''' : downstream charging code is scary. Mainline code only reads info, and doesn't charge, so a brave soul might be able to figure out a minimal setup that does charge the phone.
* '''Extcon''' : downstream extcon is not too bad, and it is trivial to follow the basic use cases and ensure they are ported correctly. Mainline code is different and writes different values for diffrent use cases, but following a similar structure it can be made to behave.
* '''Flash Leds''' : these are pretty straight forward, the existing mainline code is a bit weird, but I wrote a port of downstream and it does work for the most part.
* '''Vibrator''' : the mainline code is for a different kind of vibrator. It shouldn't be too hard to port the downstream code.

==== USB ====

At the moment usb-networking works only the first time it is plugged, and only
if the (experimental) max77804k is not enabled.

There are 2 different blocks for USB on the klte. One has a good driver, and
manages the somewhat working usb networking -- let's call it simple. But if the
max77804k driver is enabled, it switches to the other IP block which does not
have mainline drivers -- let's call it complex. Downstream only has code for
the complex block.

Drivers for the complex block are present on newer SoCs from qualcomm, but at
least to me, they look different than the downstream code (downstream doesn't
have the notion of phy's, and this is a pretty big deal). So this could be
a simple fix, but likely isn't.

Another possible approach will be to somehow let the simple block handle all
the USB, but without documentation on max77804k/usb blocks this is pretty hard.

==== Graphics/Display ====

There is mainline support for the GPU with 3D Acceleration. kmscube works.

If you run phosh or plamo, you'll "crash" the display. The phone continues to
work, so this shouldn't be too hard to figure out. Check this issue: https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/issues/424

If you just let the phone sit, even with no ui (terminal cursor blinking) the
whole phone hard freezes, including usb networking, wifi networking, uart
console. And there is no warning in dmesg.
