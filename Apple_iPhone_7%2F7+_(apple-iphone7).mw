These two devices can boot Android (via Project Sandcastle) so a postmarketOS porting could be possible once flash storage drivers are added

== How to enter flash mode ==
No proper flash mode, but kernel can be booted via [https://checkra.in/ checkra1n/PongoOS]. Basic dual boot support exists.

First you have to enter DFU mode. Power off your phone and connect it to your computer via USB: Hold down  {{Button|Volume Down}} + {{Button|Power}} for 5 seconds (after Apple logo appeared). Release {{Button|Power}} and keep holding {{Button|Volume Down}} for another 10 seconds.

To enter PongoOS, from where we can load the Linux kernel, run follwoing command on the host machine:
<source lang="bash">
$ ./checkra1n-cli -cpE
</source>

PongoOS will start booting and printing messages on the screen.

== Installation ==

Currently, there are instructions at https://blog.project-insanity.org/2020/04/16/running-postmarketos-on-iphone-7/
