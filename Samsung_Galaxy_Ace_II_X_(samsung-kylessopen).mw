== Installation ==
Before installing, ensure that your host computer and your copy of pmbootstrap is fully up to date and that your system has been rebooted since it was last updated. 

; 1. init
<source lang="bash">$ ./pmbootstrap.py init</source>
Select "samsung-kylessopen" as the target device and select a working recommended graphical interface. 

; 2. install
<source lang="bash">$ ./pmbootstrap.py install --no-fde</source>
See the in progress regarding full disk encryption. 

; 3. flash
Ensure that the USB cable is disconnected, then hold down {{button|Volume Down}} + {{button|Home}} for a few seconds as the system boots. This puts the device in flash mode. Once in this mode, enter <source lang="bash">$ ./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_rootfs</source> to install the rootfs. Once this is finished, put yourself back into flash mode and enter <source lang="bash">$ ./pmbootstrap.py flasher flash_kernel</source> to flash the kernel.

== Graphical Interfaces ==
=== Matchbox ===
Matchbox is a free software (GPL v2+) window manager for the X Window System designed for embedded systems. It's latest stable release was in April of 2012, the same year this phone was known to be released in the UK. It's rather lightweight, displaying only one window at a time, and has its own software keyboard built in, making it the interface I recommend the most for this device. 

=== Hildon ===
Hildon is an LGPL user interface for cell phones. It's optimized for single touch displays. Due to the lack of a software keyboard, I wouldn't recommend it for this device. 

=== MATE ===
MATE is a fork of Gnome2 fork in response to the negative reception of Gnome3. It's initial release was in 2011 (GPLv2, LGPLv2) and it's still in active development. It doesn't come with a software keyboard and it can be slow and buggy at times. It feels more appropriate as a desktop interface. 

=== Xfce4 ===
Xfce aims to be fast and lightweight, while still being visually appealing. It follows the Unix philosophy, with each component being its own project. It's latest stable release 2015, licensed under the GPL, LGPL and BSD licenses. It doesn't come with a software keyboard. I would recommend it about as much as I recommend MATE. 

=== i3wm ===
i3wm is a tiling window manager for the X Window System. It's rather small and lightweight. It's initial release was in 2009 and is still in active development. It's licensed under the BSD license. It's highly keyboard driven, but doesn't come with a software keyboard. I would recommend this interface for users who own a hardware keyboard. 

=== Weston ===
Weston is a demo Wayland compositor. While it runs nicely on this phone, it has very limited functionality. I personally wouldn't recommend it for everyday use. 

=== Plasma Mobile ===
Plasma Mobile is a GPLv2 licensed smartphone interface. It's sadly painfully slow on this phone and rather buggy. I wouldn't recommend it.

== In Progress ==
Here is a list of tasks that are currently being worked on for this device, from highest priority to lowest. 

=== Mainlining === 
Mainlining is an important task for this device, because kernels and drivers that supposedly work for this device are scattered across various git repositories, usually forks of other projects, often heavily patched and abandoned. Relying on kernels that can have their repos deleted at any moment, that are often heavily fractured anyways probably isn't a good idea.

==== List of kernels ====
All of these kernels claim to be for this device however, it's not known which of these kernels actually work and how well they work. FrankenKernel is the only exception as it is the kernel that gets flashed when installing this device.

=== Device regularly reboots itself ===
This is almost certainly a watchdog issue, since the device reboots every 10 minutes. I'm currently working on disabling the watchdog. {{issue|242|pmaports}}

=== Internet connection ===
It's not known whether or not the internet works on this device at the moment. Having a working internet connection would make package management far easier. 

=== FDE doesn't work ===
FDE doesn't work at all for no known reason. 

=== Error starting charging-sdl ===
The device charges successfully, but charging-sdl doesn't launch, with "error starting charging-sdl". Check out [[Troubleshooting#CHARGING_MODE:_error_starting_charging-sdl|the troubleshooting page]].

=== Scrolling graphics before DE ===
Before a desktop environment starts, the screen tends to flicker and scroll. It's a purely cosmetic issue.
