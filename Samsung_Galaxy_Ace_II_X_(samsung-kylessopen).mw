Full disk encryption currently doesn't work on this device, so it should be turned off for now. 

=== flash ===
Ensure that the USB cable is disconnected, then hold down {{button|Volume Down}} + {{button|Home}} for a few seconds as the system boots. This puts the device in flash mode. Once in this mode, enter <source lang="bash">$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs</source> to install the rootfs. Once this is finished, put yourself back into flash mode and enter <source lang="bash">$ pmbootstrap flasher flash_kernel</source> to flash the kernel[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)].

Bluetooth is likely an external chip: "Bluetooth 4.0 (external WCN2243); 802.11b/g/n (external AR6003/5, WCN1314)"
WiFi is likely as well, but camera support is integrated. 

According to some websites this device may also have an FM radio, an accelerometer, a proximity sensor and a compass. I haven't found or discovered those peripherals myself but I know the device has a vibrator which most websites fail to mention. It's not on the list because I haven't physically found it yet.
