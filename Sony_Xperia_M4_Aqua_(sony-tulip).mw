* Konrad Dybcio (@konradybcio) - porting
* Patrick Hope (@Pachops) - testing
* Pavel Dubrova ([https://github.com/bartcubbins @Cubbins]) - cleaning up kernel, doing A LOT for this device kernel-wise

== How to enter flash mode ==
With device powered off, hold [VOLUME +] and plug USB cable in. Device's LED will turn blue, meaning it has entered fastboot mode.
You will need an unlocked bootloader. To unlock it follow the [https://developer.sony.com/develop/open-devices/get-started/unlock-bootloader/how-to-unlock-bootloader/ official guide by Sony].


== Model list ==
E2303 (European) - 8GB storage, LTE

E2306 - 16GB storage, LTE

E2312 - 8GB storage, 3G, Dual-SIM

E2333 - 16GB storage, LTE, Dual-SIM

E2353 - 8GB storage, LTE

E2363 - 16GB storage, LTE, Dual-SIM

== Additional notes ==
- Camera will NOT work for now, it's broken kernel-side.

- This device has not been made by Sony, it's been manufactured by FIH hence kernel needed (and still needs some) cleanup

- There are a lot, and by that i mean a LOT of variants of this device, varying mainly by baseband and storage size

- In [https://github.com/bartcubbins/kernel_kanuti Pavel's kernel_kanuti repo] you can find some work on caf's 4.9, 4.4, and 3.18 kernels, the higher the version the less things will work, but hey, there is hope

- The device can probably be mainlined since 8936/8939 is a 8916-class soc

- If camera ever gets fixed, it will need Sony's proprietary blobs to run

== Installation ==
Fastboot and TWRP zips work fine.
